## Problem Statement

A marketing agency is looking to help an online sporting goods store push their sales in 2025 with targeted ads via forum posts. The problem is the store has many different products for diferent sports and needs a way to automate this process. 

## Executive Summary

    An online sports store is attmpeting to increase sales but has reached a road block when it comes to displaying ads for their array of products. They found themselves often displaying ads to the wrong people or not getting any interest from the people that saw the ad. They have hired a marketing agency to automate this process. As we know, going through dozens or even hundreds of web pages to determine the topic, is not ideal and would be way too time consuming.
    The goal is to create an algorithm that identifies the sport of topic based on the post's text without having to even look at the website. Thus, the topic or sport will determine what advertisement will be shown. Since they often had issues showing ads to the wrong people in the past, they want to focus on minimizing false positives rather than false negatives. They prefer to occasionally show someone an an ad even if it may be mis-targeted than miss an opportunity at reaching a target audience as the cost to run a single ad is very cheap.
    Being part of the marketing analyst team, we tested and perfected models and narrowed in on one that will give the best results for the clients goals in mind. This model can be packaged for the client so they can expect to use it in the future for similar projects.
