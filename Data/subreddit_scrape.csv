1709098144.0,Leather Saddle Rail,"i currently use Selle Italia SLR saddle. Considering to move to a leather saddle as many rides are shortish and want to ride outside without changing into BIBS. Plus leather saddle looks cooler on titanium bikes

My bike fitter told me not to get Brooks saddle because of shorter rail length. My last convo with him was 2 years ago and looks bad to reach out asking for advice now.

back in 2005 i created a bike part aggregator website that intelligently exposed 10s of thousands of products obtained from crawling popular online retailers. the idea was to present all the products in one place to make cross shopping easier. back then i used to build up my own bikes from the frame up and the concept of a bike part aggregator seemed useful when looking for deals on parts. unfortunately i didn't pursue that business. my question is whether there's a need for such a site today. google seems to offer ability to cross shop for any product. however, i only find google's presentation useful as a starting point to get ideas of what the market is like for what i'm searching. do you think there's a niche market for an aggregator site in a cycling market that would have 100s of thousands of products, pricing trends, links to youtube reviews, etc. ? what features would you like such a site to offer for you to use it for cycling related shopping? thank you!",cycling,2024-02-28 01:37:07

I use trainer road they have a short build for crits and general build for all around  they also have a rolling road race and crit specialty phase. Would you mix some of the workouts together if you wanted to train for both?


I see races happening  like an  omnium with a crit one day  and road race  the next or tt,  vice versa for one event  sometimes.

How would you train for a road race and crits at the same time? Or would you pick one main event like crits races  to be your focus and road races be your secondary. 

Crits are usually under an hour .I'm  a noob racer so cat 5 so that's 30-40 minutes. The road races  im looking at are  1-3 hours.

1709063556.0,Roof Rack vs Hitch ,"Hello! 

I got my first bike (Trek Verve 2) this past weekend and I’m trying to figure out the best way for transporting it. I have a 4-door Honda accord.

I’m looking at getting the Baseline rack system from Yakima. 

So I’d love some opinions:

1) Am I truly better off getting a hitch versus getting a roof rack? Getting a hitch installed will run me about $277 at the lowest in North Dallas. However, I’m able to find odds and ends of the roof rack system I’m after on FB marketplace so cost will be a bit cheaper compared to trailer hitch & bike rack (in a perfect world I would love the Küat Sherpa Bike Rack because it would fit in the trunk of my car if I needed to store it). 

2) I’ve looked at the bike racks that would strap onto the trunk, however my car still looks relatively nice and I don’t want to scratch it over time and it makes me nervous to have the bike up secured that way. 

3) I live in an apartment building so running the roof rack into the garage isn’t a problem for today before someone says it. Is it truly that much of a pain to get it up and down off the car? 

4) Have you found cheaper, just as good alternatives to the roof rack system I mentioned above? Discounts? I found some other brands that offer a similar roof rack but would love to hear thoughts.

The rules I’m talking about are so simple that they can be explained in two minutes, but there’s a widespread lack of knowledge about them.

I’m mainly referring to the rule about how if you’re on a road, especially in town, you can’t bike on the side of the street that puts you in the opposite direction of the traffic next to you. I didn’t know this until I was 21, when a random (understandably) angry guy shouted at me for creating a dangerous situation.

1709058115.0,Is it normal to encounter dangerous car manoeuvres very frequently when cycling?,"First post here! 

For context: I’ve taken up cycling for the last 5 months and my most frequent route is a straight road for 10 minutes from my workplace to the station. The road is 40 mph, very wide and not very busy. There’s also a slow left turn I have to make at a junction and a small bridge before the station (goes over the tracks).

Now to my point, over the last week I’ve kept a tally of how many manoeuvres I’ve noticed that seem somewhat dangerous or risky that a car has completed. It’s averaged out at 6 per ride, 11 on one occasion and 3 as the lowest. 

I’ve included overtaking within less than a metre of me, overtaking when a car is coming the other way at the same time and narrowly missing them, overtaking on a slight bend and drop in the road (you can’t see what’s coming at all), turning right from the other side of the road when I am there and have right of way to turn left (I’m signalling in good time), overtaking when cycling over the bridge (again, can’t see over it at all), overtaking when I’m cycling to the centre of the road and signalling to turn right into the station or into my workplace. 

Is this behaviour normal? I don’t know if I’m just wrong about the rules of the road or if people just don’t care or understand the rules themselves?

1709053615.0,2022 Giant Contend AR 1 vs 2023 Specialized Allez Sport,"Hi everyone,

I started dipping my toe into the water last August with cycling and bought my first ever non-Walmart bike, a Giant Escape.  Took a while to solve my hands and ass feeling like they were hit by a truck, but once that was all sorted, I fell in love with the sport and have really gotten into it.

Now that I know this is something I love and want to keep doing and improve, I want to get my first ""proper"" bike with a drop bar setup for longer rides as I start to train a bit more seriously.  I have a great local bike shop and through a lot of test rides, have narrowed down my choice to either a 2023 Specialized Allez or a 2022 Giant AR Contend 1.  Giant currently has a discount going on so the price point is almost exactly the same for both (\~$1,800) even though the AR Contend 1 has a Shimano 105 Groupset vs a Tiagra on the Specialized.

I think I will be very happy with either that I choose, but was hoping I could get some more feedback from this community if anyone has experience with either.  I have no intention of racing or anything like that and while I, of course, want to get stronger and go faster, comfort on longer rides matters a lot to me.  Are they both great frames to build on in the future?  Is there anything one has implicitly that the other does not?  I average about 100 miles a week.

1709047269.0,Is my HR too high?,"Hi, I am a male 22.

Yesterday I was testing my new bike and head unit (+ Garmin HRM Plus) on a 10 km short trip (but I was riding hard). Everything was fine, aside from the low saddle height (it's going to be fixed; I would hate to ruin my knee). I did not feel dizzy or anything else; I felt great after it.

Now, I like to look at my post-ride data and see how fast I was going, etc., and I was screen sharing it (on Discord with one of my friends who has never been exercising or bicycled much but likes data in general (he is an engineer)). He saw my heart rate and freaked out... Max was 196 bpm, and the average was 176 bpm. He thinks that it's too high, and I should be concerned about it because ""it's more than twice as high as the ""normal"" heart rate.""

When I started cycling (half a year ago), I knew that my HR was going to be higher (one of my friends who has been cycling for 30+ years said that ""I am unfit and my heart is going to beat fast because it's smaller than a little bird, but it's ok""). So generally, I wasn't worried about it because I was prepared for it and I was feeling great.

1709046126.0,Canti v Mini V for Carbon Rim break Gravel bike,"Currently riding a specialised tri-cross, that got lucky with a spare set of carbon 60mm wheels. I'm currently using Cantilever breaks with handlebar/Seatpost mounted cable hangers and SwissStop Flash Pro Evo carbon pads. The break pad shoes are the post kind that were a nightmare to set up

I'm reasonably happy with the power with the current breaking setup (although more would be nice), but the speed that I'm going through break pads is a little quick for a uni student budget having gone through a set of pads in 4/500km. The wear on the pads is quite one sided both front and back. 

Would Mini V breaks, or a change in a more centralised hanger have the pads last any longer. Could it just be that I've not done a great job of setting up the pads or is this distance expected wear for these pads. Any advice would be appreciated as I'm really enjoying gravel riding but a new set of break pads every month is more than I'm willing to spend. Thank you",cycling,2024-02-27 15:02:06

However, cars will sometimes stop where the black colored area is and wave me on, while cars are still going (blue arrow). This situation confuses me, for the area is a school zone, but seems dangerous to stay in the middle of the road for I do not want to obstruct traffic. Is there a specific right of way?

Does anyone have any advice for an easy gainer to lose some weight?

My goal is to get down to 185 (race weight) from 200lbs, im in no rush, but id like to be my race weight in April/May sometime as my A race is in June. 

Im thinking about pushing the next phase of general base back 2 weeks and working in a 2 week “basecamp” of exclusively z2 in an effort to try and cut some weight. 

Background: 

I currently weight 200lbs, looking to drop to 185, im 173cm or 5’8” with a “stocky” build. My FTP was most recently estimated to be 280W and ive been doing between 7-9 hrs/wk of structured training for 3 years now. I also do 4 calisthenics workouts each week. 

I have been seeing steady gains year after year in ftp which is nice but i havent been able to get my weight to budge.

 Right now i consume about 2000cals a day 130P, 300C, 30F and consume about 500cals for a 2 hour workout (usually leaving a 400-600 deficit). My last meal is usually at 5pm and i ride around 7pm and recover with a protein shake afterwards.

1708994104.0,Variable Cycling Event Price Based on Income?,"My local regional bike club has event which raises funds to support diversity & inclusion in biking especially in those communities where access and cost of the sport can be a barrier. Each year they host a single day 60 mile ride basic with some support *(start/finish food/drink, one pit stop and a ferry ticket)* which I enjoy with a number of friends... it's a staple on our calendar. It certainly has never been a 'value' ride, but the higher cost *(I believe I paid $250 last year before donation)* is understood as its 'going for a good cause'. On top of the entry fee, you are encouraged to donate whatever additional funds you want to support the mission much like you find with so many other rides. *(Given the mission, there were options to lower your entry fee, if cost was a barrier.)*  


However this year, I was taken aback when going to register and finding the following structure for entry fees:  


*""To make this event as accessible as possible,  XXXXXXXXX is using a sliding scale fee format that simply asks registrants to select a payment level that aligns with their household income and economic situation. Reach out to XXXXXXXXX if you have questions about the sliding scale format.*  
  
*To find your suggested fee, divide your total monthly household income (pre-tax) and find your tier in the registration tiers below. For example - The household income for K's family is $3,500. Looking at the ticket type tiers below we see that K's suggested tier is B.*  
  
*This is a suggested tier, but you know your economic situation best. If cost is a barrier to participation, pay what works for you. If you’d like to support this program by registering at a higher payment, we thank you for your generous gift.*  
  
*Tier E\~ $9,000+/mo income - $500.00*  
*Tier D\~ $6,000-$9,000/mo income - $250.00*  
*Tier C\~ $4,000-$6,000/mo income - $150.00*  
*Tier B\~ $2,000-$4,000/mo income - $75.00*  
*Tier A\~ $0-$2,000/mo income - $50.00""*  


First and foremost, I'm struggling with needing to disclose my income to my cycling club, why is this necessary?  


Additionally, I'm struggle with feeling cheap for 'only' wanting to pay $250 for the ride, when I think $500 is ridiculous as an entry fee for single day event.  *(Yes, I understand they say 'if cost is a barrier...' ... however isn't $250 enough for single day ride with a single pit stop and a $8 ferry ticket? My best guess is production costs before sponsor support/donations is likely in the realm of $30-50/rider... so even at this level they are clearing $200+)*  


Finally, I'm very much hoping this is  not the start of a new trend like we're seeing elsewhere in the economy where businesses are guilting/shaming people to increasingly high 'optional' tips/fees based the perception of status/wealth, etc.  


In the end, this has gone from a 'must do' event to a 'not sure' as I don't want to pay 2x to 10x just because I am perceived by organizers to be better off than others. Feels so much better to do this by 'encouraged donation' rather than something that looks and feels like a tax.

The problem is the cycle was advertised to come with Shimano Altus/Acera Derailleurs, but all my local bike stores only have ones that are equipped with Microshift components (Im assuming the M26 or Mezzo M36).

1708973458.0,Help - Bike Recommendations,"Hello!

I am looking for some help on a bike recommendation. 

I plan to stay under $2,000. Ideally, it would be $1,200 or less. I would buy used in good shape to get a better bike to be around that $1,200 or less price point. 

First, I know I try to use my bike to fit every need. I used to use a Trek Skye S to bike commute, bike pack, ride gravel, and go on crushed limestone trails.

What I want in a bike:
-Capable of doing what I used to do (bike commute on street and concrete trails, bike pack, ride gravel, and go on crushed limestone trails)
-Ability to add a rear rack (use panniers for commuting and bikepacking)
-Carbon fork (if not a whole carbon frame to absorb road “noise” since I’m not going to have heavy front shock of a mountain bike)
-Ability to switch out tires (would love to get 2 in tires or wider on it)
-Flat bars (I’ve never ridden drops. I like a more upright, less aggressive/ comfortable ride.)
-I want and plan on pulling a kid trailer with two kids as well.

I went to a local Trek store and from their line up I am looking at the newest Dual Sport 3. Second choice from there would be the FX Sport 4 (less desirable price point and not capable of wider tires compared to Dual Sport 3). I did not look into or ride any of their gravel bikes while there. 

After reading more I’ve been thinking a gravel bike with flat bars and more relaxed geometry might be up my alley. Thoughts?  I still need to come up with what specific bikes that would be. 

So what bikes would you recommend looking at based on the information above?  Please be specific about year, make and model. I want to visit a few other bike stores that carry other brands. 

Thank you!

The bike in question is a Monoc TC2 Compact. This is an aluminium frame with carbon forks and seat stays.

I'm tall and slim so I need a fairly large frame but  38 cm handlebars. I'd like to think that justifies a custom build 😂

I (26, F) live in the UK, and have cycled into work every day for the past 4 years. On average, I’ll do around 60km (37miles) every week on a mix of roads, and some trail paths.

I’ve had two bikes in that time, one very cheap one and a Trek Dual Sport Hybrid which I love.

I try to keep the bike in good condition, giving it a thorough clean every ~120km, and I, myself can change chains, brake pads and the freewheel quite easily, but the more complex parts like bearings I cannot do myself, so take to the local cycling shop.

Anyway, any recommendations for bikes that are good for commuting? Not fussed on specs, just something that deals well with a lot of use (and rain)! I’d love for the people at the bike shop not to roll their eyes when I need to bring it in!

1708925366.0,Feeling like crap when I supposed to be in a great shape,"I am in my mid 30s M, generally quite healthy and pretty strong on the bike. I was in my best shape ever about 2 years ago when I was riding regularly 15-20 hours per week with some very long 8h+ days and I felt like I can do anything.   

Then at some point I started having these days when I just don’t feel like myself. Sometimes I could barely move my legs, 1 hour of zone1-2 riding would be the most I could manage, even on the days after a good rest. Or at other times I would feel great in the beginning of the ride but then I would gradually fade to the level where few minutes at tempo pace feels barely manageable. 

I would describe these days as when you still sick or about to get sick with something like a flu and you feel generally fine unless you do some physical activity. 

I stopped riding at some point for a month or two because it was just too much disappointment and not much pleasure and everything seemed too hard. I also had multiple shorter brakes over the last 2 years as well. 

I told all of these to my doctor and they didn’t find anything obvious that would suggest that I’m unwell. 
They suggested that maybe I have some allergies or depression. I tried to take something from allergies, does not seem to make a difference. As for depression, maybe there’s some connection, but at the same time I had many days when I’m in a great mood and yet I feel like crap on the bike. 
I think that I would get depressed because I can’t ride my bike not the other way around. 

Lately I had 3-4 really good months when I was able to train and recover really well and I had a few all time power records. I thought that I finally managed to leave whatever I had behind me. Then after my last easy week I started feeling like crap again.

1708920359.0,Bought a gravel bike… should I have gotten a MTB??,"Just a little bit of back story: I’ve had a endurance road bike that I’ve experimented with riding on gravel trails and even tried riding it on light single track (very slowly). I decided to pick up a gravel bike because of how much more fun I was having off-road. 

I’ve realized I’m riding a lot more and a lot rougher single track then I’d orginally thought. (I’d say about 20%pavement, 20% single track, 15% rough gravel, 55% gravel) At first, the fun and challenge of underbiking felt great! But now I feel a bit frustrated with how slow I go(or having to walk the bike) on the rockier, more technical descents. I even feel a bit uncomfortable with going down these descents because I feel my tires losing grip and I often feel I’m gonna tip over the bike. 

I know some of this is just my lack of technical skills. And I’m more than certain there are people who can tackle these trails with a gravel bike. But if I want a bike where I feel more comfortable and more confident it can handle any terrain I try to ride, would a XC mountain bike be a better fit? Should I keep my gravel bike and try to see if I like it more?

1708909369.0,Is tubeless road worth setting up if it's done on a rim brake 25mm tyre bike from a few years ago?,"I already have gone down the path of tubeless but I want to take a more objective look of whether or not it was and will continue to be worth it. Most of the benefits described for a tubeless road setup only seem to pay dividends I feel on a modern bike with disc brakes. When I see discussion online of the tubeless vs tubular debate it is mostly in the abstract and theoretical


The lower pressure argument I can see because on a 32mm tyre I can see many pressure calculations around the 60 psi mark. However for my setup I still have to go for 80-90 psi. In my experience going from 95 psi on my butyl inner tube to roughly 85 psi on my tubeless doesn't feel any more comfortable. That pressure level has flow on consequences because I am not sure if sealant works as well at pressures that high compared to pressures more resembling a mountain bike tyre. I don't know the science behind this but that is just my intuition. 


Another aspect is I think it is under appreciated the relative difficulty of seating a skinny road bike tubeless tyre compared to seating a wider road bike tubeless tyre. It is really disconcerting struggling with seating a tyre, going online to see a video with a reassuring tone that it's not that hard and then having them demonstrate on a mountain bike tyre. I think a slightly wider road bike tyre dramatically reduces this aggravation although I am not quite sure.


The last consideration that I think is speculative is with tubeless tyres and rim brakes specifically. I heard from someone in real life that the brake pads on the rims generates a lot of heat which has negative consequences for the sealant contained in the tyre. Supposedly it causes it to dry out and perform worse.


For older bike wheels like the one I have they are tubeless ready rather than tubeless. I always get paranoid about the rim tape not being good enough or applied correctly enough to get a proper seal inside the tyre. Is this my paranoia or is an actually tubeless wheel appreciably more confidence inspiring in the seal that it creates when compared to a tubeless ready wheel with tape to cover the holes?


For people who are tubeless converts my question would be if road bike technology never progressed beyond 25mm tyres and rim brakes would tubeless still be a no brainer upgrade or would something like latex inner tubes win out",cycling,2024-02-26 01:02:49

I'm looking for a good model for beginners. I like the running and swimming parts more than I do cycling so I don't suspect I will ever be cycling 150km or more at a time (+/- 100 at most). Since I'm not going to cycle professionally or long distance and I'm still in uni, I was hoping to buy somewhat of a budget bike (I set a loose budget of 1000 EUR. Don't know if that's reasonable?).

Two bikes that I seriously considered were Liv Avail and Canyon Endurance 7 R8 with the second being slightly over budget (which I don't really mind, but I could also get it secondhand, if you all think secondhand racebikes aren't 'used up' in any way).

Anyone got any advice on what to look for or what to avoid? Certain type of brakes that I definitley should(n't) get, frame material, brand ...?

I live in Belgium so would be nice if there's a dealer here, or at least I could have it shipped here.",cycling,2024-02-25 21:44:23
1708896024.0,WIL: A cheap road bike is a significant upgrade from a cheap city bike for speed and efficiency.,"Given that the enthusiasts on this sub tend to be experienced cyclists on different types of bicycles, I imagine that many reactions to this will be sarcastic confirmation.

However, I am making this post because I did not find a post offering this information when I was deliberating, and it put me off getting a road bicycle for many months. I hope that it can inform someone else who is wondering the same.

My comparsion: I had, in high wind terrains and in somewhat hilly (up to 8% grade over 600 meters to 1 km) areas without much wind, been using a step through Dutch bike. It was a 6 gear single gear range bicycle that was maintained, though it was second hand and not very expensive to begin with at its newest. As I got into bicycling within the past couple of years, my muscles and breathing rhythm for commuting at a decent speed (at least 20km/hr for the average) were not developed, nor were my climbing skills. I rode this bicycle for about a year every other day, getting better and more comfortable with the commute, getting faster, but as there were always multiple hills or wind (depending on my location), there were certain parts of the ride that were always more difficult. There was one hill in particular that was at a higher grade for quite a while that I wouldn't have even tried to take my bicycle up.

I switched the bicycle a couple of months ago for a single-gear-range road bike. It also has 6 gears, though the gears are not as well maintained as my old bike, and the seat on this bike tends to slowly fall down maybe 4 cm over the day. It is not as well maintained. It also has gravel tyres and is a 50 year old steel bicycle, with wider dropped handelbars.

\_\_\_\_

From my first day of riding it, the difference was not just noticable, but rather surprising. The hills (as my first day was on hills) and (later) wind that had left me winded prior I was able to move up at a faster speed (averaging 25-30 km/hr when in maybe 12-15km/h of wind for distances of 10km - which would have been closer to 20km/hr on my old bicycle, for reference), and with much less effort - almost nonchalantly. The one hill that I routed around prior, specifically because I knew that I would not be able to make it up without getting off of the bike mid-way, I was able to take with just a sustained moderate effort.

The most pronounced difference between my old and my new bicycle is for when riding is more difficult: going longer distances at a higher speed than what I used to do (at the same, or even less, effort), dealing with winds or hills. My impression is that, in a flat, non-windy setting, the road bike also goes faster - though not by much. However, I would imagine if both bicycles upgraded their gears to have higher resistance than a 6, then  I imagine that the maximum speed with comparable effort with be significantly faster with the road bike than the Dutch bike.  
\_\_\_\_

When considering switching from my Dutch cargo bike, I could not find information on if the switch from a used, not-high-quality cargo bike to a not-high-quality road bike would be worth it. I found quite a few articles for comparing between higher-quality bikes, but nothing about if this is the same if both bikes are second hand and very used. I was reluctant to give up my cargo bike because it was, well, useful for transporting cargo and fun to ride, which is why I personally waited to make the change.

Even with the falling seat, the limited single ranged gear set, the heavier tyres, and the the steel 50 year old frame, my current bike \_far\_ outperforms my last one. I conclude from my experience that, generally speaking, switching from city or cargo bikes to a road or gravel bike (not mountain) of equal quality - even for used ones with modifications - will be a significant ease if you face hills or heavy wind.

The seat, while annoying, I can live with until I replace the saddle's bar to something a bit thicker, and I will probably change the cassette - as the current one could stand to be replaced, and I would like more resistance for flat surfaces and lower gearing for more intense hills. Otherwise, I am very happy with the change.

I would not have changed if I didn't want speed, I had cargo to transport that I couldn't easily put in a backpack, I had short city commutes within a particular neighbourhood (i.e using a bike as essentially a faster option than walking a distance that could be commuted by foot in a reasonable time frame), if I wanted to focus on using the rides for fitness and strength training. My desires were to move in cities  with agility, speed, and less effort to arrive at my destinations without being out of breath -- but also being able to go for longer cross-city or cross-country rides if I wanted to have a physical challenge. This worked for me. If you have similar goals, it may work for you, too.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

End of post. TL ; DR: Road bikes are still more efficient than city or cargo bikes even if not of high quality or not being very well maintained - as long as it is reasonably efficient and safe.",cycling,2024-02-25 21:20:24

I’ve let go of my Supersix Evo as it was too large for me. I loved the bike, and every ride under 1-2 hours felt fantastic. Rocket ship on wheels, super light, Ultegra DI2 which was amazing. But I couldn’t ride it for long. 

I’ve found an Orbea Orca from 2020, 105 DI2 12s, just smaller than the Supersix, and pretty close to a bike I know I liked to ride. So it should fit me well.

1708888949.0,US Cities with good paved cycling/multi-use paths,"I live in the United States and will be moving in the next few years for work.  
Curious about where in the US I might find good cycling. It's GREAT to have a city where I can cycle to do my errands or ride to work, but that topic is pretty well covered and I have some ideas there. What I'm having a harder time with, is where can I go out an cycle on the weekend on a wide paved trail that is off the road. Depending on my level of fitness at the time, I like to do anywhere between 20 and 40 miles per ride.  
For examples of what I mean, San Antonio, TX has a nice multi-use path that rings the city that I think is nearly 80 miles long. Austin, in my experience, had very little in the way of paved paths longer than about 7 miles so I rode them repetitively until I was bored to tears. The Dallas/Fort Worth area has the Trinity trail which, while not always paved (crushed gravel) is extensive. Houston has the paths along the bayous. And Boulder, CO had some nice paved trails as well. As you can see, the vast majority of my biking experience has been in Texas, but I'm not really looking to stay here.  
Would love to know if you have experience in other cities/other states of places for these types of rides or if you can point me to an online resource that might have this information. I've tried just using the bike layer on google maps, but it's a pretty tedious way of doing it. Ideally, I'd love to live in a place where I could bike to the paths rather than loading my bike on my car to get there, but it is not a dealbreaker.

I'm probably going to train a little before it as I'm do more longer rides, 75-125km etc. also probably practice carrying a bag with supplies in. 
I also have a spare set of thinner tyres for my mountain bike meaning it 'hopefully' won't be as draining.

I have a Dual Sport 3 Gen 5. It works for my more spirited rides, but I find it so cumbersome and “sluggish”. I find myself wanting something more nimble for daily use and commuting. 

Since I live in the flat city of Chicago and practically never switch gears anyhow for my riding style, I am leaning towards getting a Single Speed. I don’t want a fixie outright, as I like to coast. 

As this will be a commuter, I am also interested in a belt driven system… I had previously written belts off as being too new-wave and unnecessary, but the “zero maintenance” thing is very appealing to me. Maybe that’s a mistake, I’m unsure.

Here is what I think I’m looking for:

Must Have:
- Flat Bar handlebars  
- Dual Disc Brakes (front/back)
- Single Speed (can coast)
- Mounting Points for a small cargo rack

Wants:
- Hydraulic Disc Brakes 
- Belt driven (not chain)
- Comfortable but light tires for road use
- <$2k


Two options I know of and are interested in are: 

- Bombtrack Outlaw (tires look pretty heavy though?)

- AllCity Super Prof SS (but this is chain driven)

- Priority Continuum (isn’t SS. Has a “CVT” gear system. Plus 31lbs). 

- Wabi but these are all rim brakes I believe 

Anyone have and insights or thoughts to help me narrow down my search?

1708863903.0,Silca sealant clogging presta valves,"Went full tubeless last year.  Tried Stan's and Orange and was flatting all the time.  Switched to Silca and the flats have stopped but no matter what I do I can only top off the wheels with air 2-3 times before the valve gets completly blocked with sealant which didn't happen with other sealants.  [note- I am NOT adding sealant through the valve or valve stem, only directly into the tire.  Clogging happens when adding air]

Before adding air I spin the wheel as fast as possible to pull any liquid out of the stem and stop with the valve at 4 or 8 o'clock and let it sit for a minute so any remaining liquid can, in theory, drain out but it seems to make no difference.  As soon as I push the pump onto the valve it's a white spray of sealant.  

Valves are cheap to replace but it's ridiculous and wasteful how many I'm going through and if I do puncture on the road and can't re-inflate the tire that won't be fun.  

Tip/tricks to solve this?

My helmet took the brunt of it and my jersey is torn but I'm all good. My left shifter and hood was damaged but still reasonably working to get home. Then I cycle some 5 km more and come to an intersection. There were no signals but everyone was moving right at that moment, so i kept the same pace as the traffic but suddenly a car cuts in from the left and stops right in front of me. I slowed down enough for it to not be too bad but i still hit him and now my right hood and shifter is gone too. I just hitched a ride after that to the bike shop and now I'm going back to my hostel.

In those first couple years I was riding more relaxed geometry bikes, middle of the road shoes, etc. Eventually I moved to an SL7 Tarmac, the super stiff shoes, etc. Rode it for a while without any problems, have been on that setup ever since. The pain is only ever in my left foot and it sets in very early into a ride. I’m talking tingling around 7-8 miles in and then it’s just bothersome and uncomfortable around the 15-20 mile mark. I’m in decent shape and live a pretty active lifestyle between road and mountain biking, weight lifting, golf, and about 6 months ago added yoga to the mix. Up until recently the foot only bothered me on the bike, but within the last couple weeks it started being somewhat uncomfortable even just walking or going for a run. I’ve been able to get that pain under control using a lacrosse ball but it’s not helping on the bike. Just finished up a 25 miler today and the foot started nagging me as usual about halfway in. 

I have had multiple bike fits, even had another retul fit done last month. Got custom insoles made, (the Specialized ones), tried some different shoes (currently in the S Works Torch, I ordered a used pair of Lakes on eBay to try out since I’ve heard they are great for people with foot pain), also started stretching before rides, nothing seems to help. It’s to the point where I don’t even want to ride because I know my foot is going to start aggravating me which affects my performance and enjoyment on the bike.

I do have an appointment to see a podiatrist next month. Just wondering if anyone out there has dealt with something similar and if so what fixed it for you?

1708802377.0,Getting fit for 100km bike rides,"Hey everyone,

I'm intending to go on a several-day bike journey around the country in the summer, I've already started planning my routes on Strava but I have several questions/concerns, I'd appreciate to get the perspective of more experienced riders.

My total journey will amount to about 700km, and I intend to do it over 10 riding days, taking several rest days in each city along the way, the longest route I will cycle is about 100km.

1.) Fitness level and prep: I currently am not very active, and I would not call myself a cyclist, but I am a bike commuter and regularly cycle up to 10km in one commute, the longest distance I've done was a 25km ride last summer and it took me about one and a half hours with traffic stops, what is the best way to condition myself for a 100km journey? Should I include strength training in my conditioning or focus primarily on bike riding?

2.) Feeding and drinking: I've never been on rides where I regularly stopped for food and water, but I imagine a 100km ride would require that, what kind of food should I bring, how often should I stop for a quick food break, and do I need to stop for longer breaks (30+min) along the way?

3.) Time: What is the typical time for a 100km ride, on Strava it estimates the moving time to be upwards of 10 hours, but that seems way too slow for me, I have no experience with such a long ride however so I can't tell what would be a reasonable average time for the journey?

4.) Bike type: Is it reasonable to undergo this journey on a city bike or is it essential to use a road bike, are road bikes significantly faster?

1708801171.0,Just discovered Look pedals. Surprising amount of wow!,"I've been back into cycling as an adult for the last 12 or 13 years, so I shouldn't get this excited about something like a pedal, but I just picked up a new track bike and figured I would try out Look pedals since I needed a new set of shoes, and most of the loaner bikes near me have Looks installed.

I've used both of the non-zero float SPD-SLs many times in the past, but for casual Sunday rides in centuries, I settled on SPDs with a carbon-soled mountain shoe, just for ease of popping out and walking around at coffee shops.

While shopping for the perfect set of new shoes, I installed the Look cleats on what is probably the cheapest set of shoes I've ever owned (some plastic and Velcro Shimano monstrosity from 10 years ago I got at Performance Bike), and everything just feels so much better than I had expected. Clipping in is super easy, clipping out is even easier, but despite the flexi soul and the shoe, everything feels secure. 

If it matters, I got the Keo2 Max Carbon pedals for about a hundred bucks, since I had heard mixed reviews about the Blade.

1708785093.0,Kind of discouraged after some riding in Spain,"I (m39am) not much of a cyclist,  nor sportsperson, for that matter. I spent the first 25 years of my life away from sport, then had some on and off periods with running and strenght training. At 34 I become borderline obese and started experiencing health issues so I took some control of my eating and started exercising (strenght and power hiking). I lost 20 kg and solved the issues, a state that I've been keeping for 6 years now (despite two hernia surgeries, some injuries, etc.) and feel proud of. A year later I took on trail and road running, then in 2021 I added cycling. 

Initially I started with a hardtail for both MTB and road, then I upgraded to fully and added an entry level road bike. I still practice and enjoy all sports mentioned thus far regularely, even participated in several trail running competitions (where I have decent times, around middle of the table). I also had some cross country MTB races, where I was in the middle and one road biking race where I was deep within the second half, but I raced in the longest distance against some of the best amateurs where I live. 

This week I went to a short vacation to the Spanish Mediterranean coast and made two rides with a hired bike - one 120 km/1600m and one 85km/2100m. I stopped a lot for taking pictures, but besides I tried to ride with a decent pace. Afterwords I checked the Strava segments ... damn I was low ... I mean I look like one of the slowest cyclists that ever rode this segments, and there are thousands of them. Slow among all, slow among my age group, slow among my weight group. Slow on the ascends (where I am normally better), slow on descents. I know my local scene is small and undeveloped, with not so much competition, but still ... and that kind of made me feel depressed. I keep telling myself I do it all for fun, for staying healthy and keeping my weight down, that I am an office worker with a family and don't ride enough for good results, don't own power meter, don't own stationary bike/Zwift.

1708782971.0,"Another newbie ""when to upgrade"" post, are some bikes not worth training on?","Good evening all,

Skip to the \*\*\*  for the TL;DR

Before we start, I did a reddit search and tried to get a straight answer to my specific question before deciding to post here, but if I missed the answer in a previous post, please forgive me. 

I'm a newbie rider with a $150 Amazon bike. 14 speeds, 7 stages and a high/low gear (if I jacked up the nomenclature, I apologize). I \*thought\* it was a nice bike for the money. 

After an impulse 50k ride last weekend, I realized I enjoyed the hell out of the experience and want to improve my performance. 

The head of my counterpart Department got wind of my ride, and invited me out with the cycling group we have at work. He assured me not to be intimidated by everyone's fancy gear and decades of experience, and they weren't going to completely smoke me, that the goal was to get more guys in the building riding together. He saw my bike and gave the ""oof/yikes"" face and said that I should look into upgrading soon, but assured me that I'd be fine with the group. The bike is new, well maintained, just nothing fancy. I'd argue it's pretty nice for the price. It's just a generic chinese aluminum road style ""commuter"" bike I guess. 

Anyways, I joined them for a group ride, and they completely smoked me. I'm not fast, not sure what fast is, but they were averaging like 18-23mph. I stayed in the formation for the first like 15 miles, DYING the whole time,  but by the 16th to the end they were literally miles ahead. They'd wait for me to catch up, then take off again. I told them to go on without me, I was just trying to survive at this point. They made it look so easy. Just appeared to flatten hills effortlessly. I tried to shift intuitively, but could never find the right gear ( I understand I may just not be ""good"" at cycling yet) .My morale was slightly shaken, but then I remembered I was there for exercise, and riding at their speeds for as long as I lasted was an improvement in of itself.

By the the time the 50k was done, they commended my efforts, gave me some encouragement to keep coming out and ride daily with some of them, and INSISTED I look into upgrading to a ""real bike"" -that it'd make a world of difference.

Now, I'm a newb, but I've been new to many hobbies before, and based off of life experiences, I've been taught that equipment is only as good as the operator, except for at the professional levels when 1% makes a difference.  

They gave me recommendations for their favorite local bike shops and went their separate ways, and now I'm wondering if my bike is really THAT bad? Because I'm completely okay with accepting that I just need to train cycling, and demand of my body to improve. I've only been doing this for like 3 weeks, mainly riding to and from work (about 10 minutes) and to the stores out in town on a commuter bike.

I can afford a nicer bike, but is it even worth it right now? One dude said "" it's like comparing a Prius to a Lotus.""

Riding my ""Prius"" until it breaks would only make me better in the long run, right?

\*\*\*TL;DR, are some bikes just not worth training on? 

Thanks for your time.

The more I think of it though, the less it makes sense at this point, because I'm still kind of in the beginning and the bike is fine actually. I would like some upgrades though, especially the wheelset, the current one is around 2kg. 

So the idea right now is, when buying a new wheelset, to already think of the next bike in the future to take the wheels there, because there is always a version of carbon bikes with a nice frame and a nice groupset and shitty wheels, which would be the one to go for in the future. Don't want to buy the wheels twice in a sense. 

So now I try to find wheels that are good enough in the long run, but are not exaggerated for the current bike either and the question would be if super light alloy wheels are the way to go or if I should go for carbon wheels directly?

Hi so I’m new to biking, though have been doing it enthusiastically and religiously for the past 7 months, so excuse me if my question sounds ignorant, but I have a worry.

So I have a vision problem in my left eye that has been unresolved for 2 years. I lost part of my vision in my left eye and I have large parts of my vision that are just black. My right eye is (thankfully thankfully thankfully thank god and all the heavens) fine. I did the tour of ophthalmologist, neuro-ophthalmologist, blood tests, immune disease tests, scan and MRI etc. but they didn’t find anything.

The problem is I can’t see very well out of my left eye and the other day I was commuting by bike and I wanted to look behind me over my left shoulder, so with my left eye, to check if anyone/anything was behind me.

Then I realized I couldn’t see because my black spots of vision are right at the corner of my vision and I can’t turn around that much to reach the seeing parts of my eye, so to speak. Think of it like a laser.

So I was like, oh no worry, I’ll just look over my right shoulder next time so that I use my right eye. But since I’m riding on the right it didn’t seem so efficient. I mean to be fair, it worked and I’m always extra careful while riding and never had any problems. I also wear sunglasses so they help.

But that got me thinking. If ever things get worse and I completely lose vision in my left eye (god forbid) would I still be able to ride in traffic? 

I know you need two eyes technically to have a good field of vision and it takes time to adjust once you lose that (I can certainly attest since I fell and bumped into things more while walking since my slight vision loss).

The other thing is, I don’t know if this is a thing everyone does but while biking I’m very attuned to the sounds of vehicles, cars, bikes, and people. I can always tell when another biker is behind me just by the sounds. I listen to the vibrations of the road to check if any cars are coming before confirming it with my eyes. And it always works well. So that’s another point in favour of my vision-less biking.

I’m certainly not blind, I can see but I have some dark spots. It is definitely not ideal but they do not really present a problem for biking at the moment. I’m just worried if in case one day this problem were to get worse and I cannot bike again .

My night vision has, on the other hand, improved since starting biking in the evenings.

I guess the question is say I were to only see out of my right eye, would I still be able to bike, especially in traffic? Has anyone experienced a similar issue?",cycling,2024-02-24 01:37:41
1708737634.0,First road bike - Pedal recommendation,"Today I bought a Giant Contend AR 3 as my first road bike and first brand new bike. I didn't really have a plan for pedals when I bought the new bike and will probably start with the pedals & shoes I already have. 

I'm coming from a 2003ish Trek 7500FX which I absolutely love and am planning to keep for riding with the kids. The 7500 has Shimano PD-A530 pedals (flat & clipless combo) and I have some mountain bike style shoes that are showing their age.

I bought the 7500 and then the pedals/shoes when I was doing a bit of riding with the scouts, so they were a good for my riding then, but maybe not now. 

Recently (the last 5 years) I'm almost exclusively on the road or a paved trail, which is where the Contend will spend nearly all of its time. 

I really only need flat pedals on the 7500 and my shoes probably need to be replaced so that means I'm open to switching systems if it is worthwhile. 

I don't want to break the bank, but I don't really know what a reasonable budget is. I ride for fitness and stress relief so the latest, greatest and lightest is not required. 

Any suggestions or input would be appreciated.

Edit: Based on the first replies, I'm going to stay with the style I already have. Now I just need to figure out which pedals I want for the new bike.

Edit 2: Thank you to everyone who replied. I have a much better idea of what I want now and what that would cost.",cycling,2024-02-24 01:20:34

I also did a 100km ride under 4 hours, and 50km under 2 hours. Average speed is usually around 20-23kmh (except those 100 and 50km rides of course). 

This year I want to structure my rides a bit better. I’d like to have an avg speed closer to 30kmh and do the first 300km ride, plus a multi day 900km tour. My gear is:

1. Apple Watch Ultra (with WorkOutDoors app)
2. Endurance bike with a powermeter
3. iPhone instead of a bike computer, using Komoot for the rides 

As of now, I don’t have any specific training plan. I do 2-3 hours zone 2 rides in the gym, and then usually 50+km rides on the weekends, if weather allows. 

What work be great to have is an app/service that has:

1. Import of routes from Komoot or gpx so that I can still use it for navigation;
2. Shows me data from power meter and any other data;
3. Ability to track my performance on particular routes (for example I have in Komoot  a good 50km route that I use for intensive push as hard as I can workouts, but I can’t properly compare one ride on this route to another);
4. Some built in / generated training plans, that adjust based on my progress and data;
5. Show me what I need to do during the ride - like telling me to push harder, or chill, or keep power at the certain level;

Constraint I have is that I am not willing to get a dedicated bike computer nor I want to ditch my Apple Watch, so it’s still needs to be heart data from the watch and everything well connected to the phone. I know that third party apps can’t stream heart data from the Apple Watch and I can live with that, as long as the heart data is later pulled from the Apple Health. 

Is there an app/service that checks all the boxes for me that you can recommend?

Then by chance yesterday, Mirider put a video on their saying the best way to secure it for insurance purposes was:

>through the top part of the chainset protection wheel mount

looking at the linked video, could a thief not just cut that section off the frame (it not being a structural part) and take the bike, or am I thinking too much into that?

my worry is they just cut that off, leave the lock undamaged and then invalidate your claim if you are unlucky enough.

1708683386.0,"Bike frame size question, due to my ridiculously long torso","Hi /r/cycling

I am currently in market for my first road bike, and I am struggling to figure out my correct size.

My height is 182~183cm (6 ft), but pants inseam is 28~30.   (Usually, guys in my height wears 32~34 )

This disproportional height & inseam is confusing Trek's size finder, and it is literally asking me to double check my height & inseam.

In my case (short leg but long torso), what size should I purchase?

Would I be better off with 58 cm? (There's a used bike in my local market that I would like to purchase, and it is 58 cm)

Or, should l I just stick with 54~56cm?",cycling,2024-02-23 10:16:26
1708683033.0,What do I do when I'm on an adult trike and the bike lane is really busted?,"So I use a 24'' Adult Trike, bought it last year after my dad was having some complications and wanted to try riding it around before winter came at the time. I mostly got it cause I know my mom probably would want me to buy her a few things and I don't wanna eat pavement half the time. When I did, I saw that in a lot spots of the bike lanes heading to town are impossible to ride on with how cracked and broken they were.

These aren't small ones either, they're like huge chunks of road are broken off. There was a few spots where I could ride in the bike lane but a lot of times I've almost fell into the underbrush or a ditch cause there was a divot in it before I can reach the main drag. It's gotten annoying the last few days when I've tried to ride and I don't know if it's alright or not to ride in the street for a bit.

I have pulled off to the side and stopped if I see there's a car coming in my mirror then let them pass, but I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing. Where I live doesn't really get that many cars and has a low speed limit until I get near the main street where it's really busy however by then I can just go onto the sidewalk or the better bike lanes. Sorry if it's worded awkwardly, I've re-written it a couple of times to explain it as best as I can.

Edit: I also forgot to mention this right as I post it. I live in the boonies outside of my town, it's a very dense forest for a least a mile till you reach some of the farms or cul-de-sacs. The roads in general out that way are kept in better condition than mine.

Edit 2: Was not aware of how many different types of bikes there are and how sturdy they actually are. I didn't think a two wheeler would be something I'd want since I've heard quite a few people fall off for having too much in their baskets or the bags getting caught on the wheels. Thank you to everyone that has been recommending me a bunch of different options! I'll need to research what kind of bike I wanna get myself in the future.",cycling,2024-02-23 10:10:33

1708679437.0,Tarmac SL8 Expert w/ S-Works Cockpit vs. Cannondale Supersix Evo 2,"Hi there!

  
I actually settled with the thought of getting the Tarmac but now discovered a good offer for the Supersix Evo 2 and are kind of indifferent between the two. Here the hard facts:  


Tarmac SL8 Expert

* Price: 6.6k EUR
* SRAM Rival etap
* Probably like 7.7kg (will get the Roval Rapide cockpit from the S-Works)
* Going forward, there is potential to save further weight f.e. when the cassette is done
* Comes with powermeter  


Cannondale Supersix Evo 2

* Price: 6.1k EUR
* Ultegra di2 (better groupset for lower price, should i feel bad?)
* But: 7.8 kg (despite lighter groupset, despite default carbon cockpit, despite absence of powermeter)
* So less potential to safe weight, going forward
* No powermeter

A lot of people are murming about the Expert that it's crazy expensive given the fact that it comes with a Rival groupset. Yes, this is true and you hardly find any bike in that category that doesn't have a SRAM Force or Ultegra. BUT: it is still as have as peer bikes, despite the alloy handlebar, heavier group set and powermeter. I'd be able to get it with the S-Works cockpit for 6.6k EUR.  
If I wouldn't have discovered an offer for the Supersix Evo for around 6k EUR, I'd go for the Tarmac.  


So given these facts, what would be your pick? Any advice for SRAM Rival vs. Ultegra? I only rode an ordinary 105 so far. Tried the Rival Etap, feels crisp.

1708677985.0,[update] Puncture repair superhero,"[update]

I fixed a strangers puncture!

The weather over here has been dreadful, so this guy was a hero for braving the rain and wind, unluckily a large piece of glass found its way into his tyre while he was about halfway home. i found him about 200metres later. Very mucky commuter bike, took about 9-12 mins to fix. 700c x 22 tyre which was the exact tube I had on me!

I did manage to snap one of my tyre levers whilst doing the job though, but can always get another one. I’ll repair his old tube and take it with me next time I run. 

Current kit is:
 700c x 23-35 tube
2 tyre levers
Topeak mini pump.
It all slots into my OMM classic running pack. 

If anyone else feels inspired to do this, LMK and we can start a reddit community 🤓


[Original post]

I hate getting punctures.

So I want to start helping out the people I see on my ride/runs around london who are pushing bikes with punctures. 

My thought is that if i always carry a few innertubes, small multitool, pump and some tyre levers. Then i’d be able to get these people back on the road and help spread a bit of joy. 

My first question though is what size tube variants should I carry to ensure I can help in the maximum amount of situations? 

(Btw, the old tubes i’ll take home and repair)

I usually ride 80% on road and 20% single/double track. I'm pretty handy and can do almost any repair on a bike in my garage.

Anyways, Im looking at drop bar gravel bikes. Im looking at the State 4130 w/ 650b tires, Triban GRVL 120, Marin Nicasio+, Poseidon Dropbar redwood, Poseidon Dropbar X Ambition, and finally the Marin Kentfield.

&#x200B;

I am torn between he State, and the Marin Nicasio+, and the dropbar x ampition. I think the State bike makes the most sense as it has pretty beefy tires (i know this is minor) and through axles. I am a huge believer in 1 by drive trains so that is pretty much a must for me.

I also plan on  upgrading to hydro breaks at some point and probably a new saddle and new tires.

1708627062.0,Could those old style carbon bikes with metal joins ever make a comeback?,"I suspect no but I have been wondering.

There's a guy in my town-like-zipcode that commutes on what definitely looks like an old school carbon frame with aluminum joins holding tubes of carbon fiber together.  This got me thinking about those, and how simple their construction must be compared to what I have seen of modern carbon fiber construction - where sheets are pressed into forms by hand and set with resin.  The whole thing is labor intensive but the joins between different stays and tubes seems to be the worst of it.

Tubes, though, can be machine-rolled, yeah?  And hydroforming aluminum for bike parts is older than I am.

I recall the worst part of these old frames being galvanic corrosion destroying the join up between metal and carbon, but for all I know that eventually got solved.

Could machined carbon tubes and aluminum joints ever make a comeback as a way to provide cheaper carbon frames in the face of rising bike costs, or is that technology utterly outmodded for any use?  I suspect this is the case, personally, but I am no expert.",cycling,2024-02-22 18:37:42

1708624154.0,Coaching Thoughts: SLEEP FOR ENDURANCE ATHLETES,"# SLEEP FOR ENDURANCE ATHLETES

  
The significance of proper sleep for endurance athletes extends far beyond mere rest, playing a pivotal role in both physical recovery and peak performance. A wealth of modern research underscores this, with a study in the ""Journal of Sports Sciences"" demonstrating that extended sleep improves key performance metrics such as reaction times, accuracy, and speed among athletes (Mah et al., 2011). This research highlights the critical role of deep sleep stages, during which the body undergoes significant repair and growth processes, including muscle tissue repair and growth hormone release. These processes are vital for endurance athletes who subject their bodies to prolonged and intense physical stress, indicating that optimal recovery, akin to training and nutrition, is a cornerstone of athletic performance.  
Cognitive functions and psychological well-being are also deeply influenced by sleep, aspects that are fundamentally important for the mental endurance required in sports. A study published in the ""Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports"" by Fullagar et al. (2015) found that sleep deprivation leads to marked impairments in mood and cognitive functions, including decreased motivation and increased perception of exertion. These effects can severely impact an endurance athlete's training and competition outcomes, where strategic thinking, decision-making, and mental resilience are key. Adequate sleep, therefore, not only aids in physical recovery but also prepares the mind for the mental challenges of endurance activities, supporting the notion that sleep is integral to comprehensive athletic preparation and success.  
The relationship between sleep and metabolic health further underscores its importance for endurance athletes. According to research in ""Sports Medicine"" by Knufinke et al. (2018), proper sleep facilitates optimal metabolic function, which is important for energy management during extended periods of exercise. This study points out how adequate sleep promotes better glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, enhancing the body's ability to utilize energy stores effectively. Mon top of all that, sleep influences the balance of hormones that regulate appetite and satiety, such as ghrelin and leptin, which can affect nutritional intake and body weight management, essential components of an endurance athlete's performance strategy.  
Given these insights, it's clear that sleep is an indispensable component of an endurance athlete's regimen. Not only does it play a critical role in physical recovery and metabolic health, but it also significantly impacts cognitive function and mental resilience. The evidence from contemporary research presents a compelling case for the prioritization of sleep within the training schedules of endurance athletes. By fostering a deeper understanding of sleep's multifaceted benefits and integrating this knowledge into training and recovery programs, athletes can unlock their full potential, achieving greater performance heights and maintaining long-term health and well-being.

1708623554.0,Troubleshooting trainer bike damage,"Hello guys,

Was going to post this on bikewrench but saw the rule of ""is it safe"" and, since it's part of my question, I thought this sub was more appropriate.

So, I know I should get a dedicated old bike for my smart trainer, but I've been using my carbon road bike and I've noticed some damage on the frame holds for the thru axle: some ""pressing"" and uneven wear on the inside. I've ridden \~2000 (virtual)km so far.

I've checked the floor and it seems that it has a slight inclination. Also, I went through the spacers provided in the trainer and I was probably using the wrong one, one that was a bit small I would say. I addressed these two issues by stabilizing the trainer and switched the spacer. 

If that's ok, these imgur link ([https://imgur.com/a/OirG9b9](https://imgur.com/a/OirG9b9)) contains the photos from the frame, and the floor inclination.   
My two questions would be:

1. Do you think it could be anything else? (the damage)
2. How extensive do you think the damage is?

I can provide more photos if needed, thanks a lot in advance!",cycling,2024-02-22 17:39:14
1708623389.0,"Has titanium ever been widely used to make bike components, and if not, why?","I'm talking about components, not frames, which is a whole other thing that appears to be experiencing a bit of a resurgence. But it seems that most bike components, e.g. derailleurs, seat posts, chainrings and cranks, etc., are made with either steel, aluminum alloy or carbon fiber, but not titanium. I've come across Ti cassettes, but they're really expensive. I'm sure that other types of Ti parts have been made, but they're fairly uncommon and I'm just wondering why.

Is it the cost of Ti and the difficulty of working with it and high level of expertise it requires, is it because it doesn't wear as well as other materials where friction and flexing are routine, is it because it just doesn't solve any problems that need to be solved in terms of weight, strength and longevity, or is there some other reason?

I took it back to the shop. They changed the tube for free but didn’t report finding anything on the rim to cause a puncture. Then he told me it’s probably from the heat and friction from being on a on wheel trainer. I’m finding that hard to believe. I’ve used on wheel bike trainers for over 10 years before this and never got a flat.  I changed the bike I was using this Fall.

1708615574.0,Canyon Ultimate CF SL 7 Di2 vs Trek Emonda SL 6 Disc Pro,"Hi,

I currently have a commuter bike (fuji feather) and gravel bike (trek checkpoint ALR), and I'm looking to get a new road bike to keep up with people on group rides. I ride often and will use the bike a lot -- several times per week. My fuji is quite aggressive geo and it poses no issue for me, so I figured I should go with a more aggressive geo bike for this road bike, especially since my priority is a bit more speed.

I'm torn between these two options:

* Canyon ultimate cf sl 7 Di2: [https://www.canyon.com/en-us/road-bikes/race-bikes/ultimate/cf-sl/ultimate-cf-sl-7-di2/3556.html?dwvar\_3556\_pv\_rahmenfarbe=R101\_P03](https://www.canyon.com/en-us/road-bikes/race-bikes/ultimate/cf-sl/ultimate-cf-sl-7-di2/3556.html?dwvar_3556_pv_rahmenfarbe=R101_P03)
* Trek emonda sl6 disc pro: [https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en\_US/bikes/road-bikes/performance-road-bikes/%C3%A9monda/%C3%A9monda-sl/%C3%A9monda-sl-6-disc-pro/p/32562/](https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bikes/road-bikes/performance-road-bikes/%C3%A9monda/%C3%A9monda-sl/%C3%A9monda-sl-6-disc-pro/p/32562/)

I'm not willing to spend much more than $3500. Both the Canyon and Trek are $3600.

Points about the Canyon: looks way better imo, Di2 seems nice (I used Di2 once on a bike test ride and it felt great), I don't like the more-aero handlebars because it seems more annoying to fit common attachments onto there, I've heard the D-shaped seatposts can have more issues than normal seatposts.

Points about the Trek: looks way worse imo, I have a Trek shop <3 miles away from me, so that's quite convenient for me in terms of getting adjustments done for free after I buy a bike from them, and I can try the bike in person before buying it to get the sizing right (I'm in between 56 and 58, my checkpoint is 58 -- I'm 5' 11"").  


Overall, I feel like the canyon is way sexier, but the lifetime warranty on the trek frames + having the trek shop so close makes me wonder if I should go with the trek.

1708615071.0,Confused myself with tyres,"So I have Cube Cross Race Pro that I now use only for commuting on city roads.
After the stock tyres (Schwalbe X-One All-round) got few punctures I wanted peace of mind and went with Schwalbe Marathon plus, they served well as I got no punctures in the past year, but I've grown to hate the ride, they just don't roll well and are super harsh ride, in compare to X-One All-round.

I've searched previous posts here for some recommendations and been considering either Pirelli Velo or GP5000 All season...
But just don't want to spend over 100 euros on tyres that I won't like.... And maybe these are stupid choice for what I want from tyres, but with very little previous experience it's hard to say...

After I had couple of accidents I am not keen on proper road tyres, maybe I'd be fine with them, but again requires to buy a set to try it out, which is a cost I don't want to waste....

Really what I'm looking for is reasonably punctureproof tyre that has good grip, around 32-35 width and that rolls well while not super harsh ride...

1708610482.0,New to Cycling: Bike Advice Needed for Commuting & Trails,"Hello r/cycling community!

I'm moving to Honolulu next month and am in the market for a bike that will mainly serve for commuting to work and occasional rides around town, but I'd also like the flexibility to use it for trails every now and then (possibly more if I get into it). Given these needs, I'm leaning towards getting a hybrid or mountain bike. However, I'm quite new to the cycling world and am struggling with how much I should invest in a bike.

I've explored the used bike market but have some concerns about potentially overpaying for a bike that might require frequent repairs down the line. The idea of getting a bike for under $200 is appealing mainly because the sting of it getting stolen wouldn't be as severe. On the other hand, I've found new bikes starting around $550, which seems like a good deal, but I'm hesitant to make that kind of investment without knowing how much use I'll actually get out of the bike. I plan to be in Hawaii for at least 1 year, and up to 3 years if my postdoc goes well.

Given these considerations, I'm seeking your advice on a few points:

1. What's a reasonable amount to spend for someone in my situation? Is it worth investing in a new bike considering my tenure in Hawaii, or would a used bike suffice?

2. For those who've gone the used bike route, how do you mitigate the risk of buying a bike that ends up needing frequent repairs? Are there specific things to look for or avoid?

3. If anyone has specific models or brands that have worked well for them in similar situations, I'd love to hear about it. I'm all ears for recommendations that balance cost, durability, and versatility.

I’m leaning towards paying for the new bike to avoid some of the headache that comes with repairs, but appreciate any advice you can provide.

I have anterior pelvic tilt and hate feeling pressure when rotating my pelvis forward on a saddle, but NONE of the waved saddles I bought work for me.

A few things I've noticed so far: I need a wider platform, but not too wide or my feet go numb. A too-narrow saddle hurts my pubic arch. Too flat and I can't rotate my pelvis forward, arching my back and causing pain. Too soft, and it's just immediately uncomfortable.

1708589235.0,MTB tyres grip more than road tyres (maximum grip),"I recently made a comment in this respect in another thread and it was downvoted to oblivion, while at the same time hardly anybody tried to refute the point in any meaningful way. (Typical reddit, hey? so annoying). Those who responded said that road tyres grip more than MTB tyres. I think not. 

I haven´t found a direct answer to this in Google so let me open this thread and please this time try to reason your answer.

My opinion, based on my gut feeling with road bikes (current tyre GP5000) and MTB (current front tyre Magic Mary) is that in ideal conditions (when you are on top of a particularly nice hard packed mud for example) an MTB tyre will grip much harder than a road tyre in the best possible dry tarmac. It may seem counterintuitive, after all off road conditions are usually not ideal and grip is often not good, but I´m talking about ideal conditions, MAXIMUM grip of the tyre.

The reason why this is so would be due to the wider surface of the tyre. A very wide slick tyre on tarmac would probably grip more than my Magic Marys on hard mud, but road tyres are usually very thin, so that´s why they grip less. They reach the limit of the rubber faster. (think how drag cars need such wide rear tyres in order to sustain the hard torque of the engine) . We´ve been taught that friction doesn´t depend on surface area, but that´s an oversimplification, in the real world it does.

Something else that would point in this direction would be to compare MTB disk brakes and road ones. MTB ones are much beefier. Why would that be so, if not because the maximum grip of (good) MTB tyres is higher?",cycling,2024-02-22 08:07:15
1708586226.0,Rim brake wheel on a QR disc brake bike for trainer use,"I recently upgraded to a 2017 tarmac that has disc brakes, but still uses quick release skewers. Since I have nice tires on my wheels, I would prefer to have a spare wheel for trainer use only with a wheel on trainer (kickr snap). However, I know swapping between disc brake wheels takes a lot of adjustment. 

I’ve been recommended to use a rim brake wheel instead, since I don’t need to brake on the trainer and they are both quick release. Does anyone have any experience with this? I have read that the hub widths between disc and rim brake wheels with QR are slightly different (130 vs 135 mm). If anyone has done this, are there any special considerations I should take, besides blocking the brake to protect the pistons?

1708570570.0,5th Birthday Bike: Sizing Quandary,"My daughter turns 5 in March and we're getting her a bike! This is her first. She got a 2nd hand balance bike, but she never really enjoyed using it, preferring a trike. 

I've seen a bunch of different size charts online for kids Bikes. She is 46 inches tall, with a 20 inch inseam. Some places put her in 16, others 20. 18 seems like a sweet spot but that is a very rare find. 

Is it okay to lean slightly larger? Or would slightly smaller be easier for her to learn and manuever on? 

Originally i was going to get her a [retrospec 16 incher,](https://retrospec.com/collections/kids-bikes/products/koda-plus-16-kids-bike-4-6-yrs?variant=42241409024172) until i measured her today and was shocked to find how big she's gotten! 

Gaurdian suggests a [20 inch small](https://guardianbikes.com/products/20-inch-small-bike?variant=32988819554397). Love that she could grow into it (especially at the price) but i dont want it to be too huge and unwieldy. Or maybe the size will help her be more big and stable? 

Any reccos or thoughts on a really reliable sizing chart or brand? Would love to keep it 250 or less, and frankly would love to get a few years out of this bike at least, especially at that price. If she's destined for a better time on a 16 incher, I might want to go cheaper and get her somethign nicer once she's properly at the right size.

1708526347.0,Even starting cycling in winter is fun,"Around 2 months ago I wrote a post about my first ride on a road bike where I struggled to switch gears. Now 150km later I can say that's a lot less of a problem. The rides I had lately where some of the best sports experiences I ever had. I got from struggling on the short 5k ride to doing a 35k ride with a bit more than 400 meters of climbing in under 2 hours. Though a lot of that improvement came from learning what gear to use (usually the two easiest ones) on the climbs. I can't wait for spring to come around to ride in weather that isn't rain and under 10 degrees though.   
Another advantage I found is that I saw a lot of stuff I usually do not get to see when travelling by bus or car, a lot of wild animals like bunnies and deer, beautiful forest roads etc.   
The biggest feeling of achievement for me is the moment you reach the top of a climb and just get to look down with a nice view as compensation. Even though while climbing I often ask myself if this is what I want to be doing with my day. 

On my last ride I saw a little peloton of other cyclist who were encouraging me and giving me some tips about placing my feet on the pedal (Yes I do use flat pedals). Overall a really wholesome thing as they were going really fast before but went with me for a few hundred meters before we split ways again.   
But there are a few things that I find scary/ annoying:

\-My toptube bag: I got it because I could insert my phone and use it for navigation without dangling my phone in front of the handlebar without any protection. But what I found is that I can't look at it without losing sight of what happens in front of me and it's in the way of my legs if I start standing up when climbing. So all in all bad purchase for me. 

\-Cars: In my few kilometers I did I witnessed one car crash just some 50 meters  in front of me which was quite scary because it made me think of what would have happened if I was in between those two. And the other incident in which a car delivery van passed me and ran me off the road. I anticipated him and could hit the brakes as I could hear him and saw the cars coming on the other lane and because I read about those crazy drivers in this sub. But when going somewhat faster I can't hear cars until they are basically next to me. Is the Garmin rear light a solution here? And does it work standalone?

One last thing: People go on  talking about heart rate and cadence here. For cadence, do you count how many pedal strokes you do per minute or how do you manage it? For heart rate I never saw it go higher than 165 is this normal for a 24 year old? Or am I just staying far off my limit?   


All in all cycling for me is a positive change in my life since it created a reason for me to be outside!

That said, there's obvious disadvantages - the weight penalty and making your bike more back-heavy, and the fact that you absolutely cannot do anything if your belt snaps on the go.

But with that it still seems on paper like many might benefit from a *super* easy to maintain drivetrain.

I've been using a Garmin Edge 830 for about two years now. Great device but there really is one thing that bugs me, which is the lap summary that pops on your screen every time you hit the lap button. 

The thing is, when you do interval sessions and you really want to nail the interval power goal, the lap summary is displayed 'on top' of the regular data screen, blocking the power data. So for like 10 seconds, you can't see what power you're actually hitting. This is especially annoying when you're doing short, like 30s, intervals because you're left in the dark for most of the interval. 

Do you guys know if there's a way to turn off this lap summary screen?

1708491259.0,Fit and Components Help Request - Cranks - XS Surly Bridge Club (Short Rider!),"Peace yall, 

I am working to get my partner a bike that both fits her and also does we want to do. So, the Surly Bridge Club seems to fit what we want. She's 5'2"", and based on standover height, she's thinking XS will fit best, but we'll try out both the XS and the SM just in case.   


We've gone over the 26"" vs. 27.5"" wheels and tire combos to see if that might make more sense, and it looks like the swap wouldn't give that much more standover (or, my concern: rolling mass and steering feel), for the cost of rebuilding wheels, etc. But if you have thoughts on this, please let me know. 

&#x200B;

The last thing that stands out for me is cranks. The newest BC comes with Cues cranks, which don't seem to come in anything shorter than 170mm. Does anyone know of a manufacturer of short cranks that would work on the BC? I'm really guessing and looing at 152.5-155mm(?) -- I think they would have to be shorter than 165 to have any effect at all. She has a bad knee, so I want to help in all ways possible (to give more detail on that, it is mostly irritated by impact and back-motion, i.e., coaster brake type of pressure; i think shorter cranks would help avoid minor \~overextension which would mimic that coaster brake pressure, if that makes sense). I can ask Surly about specifics in terms of standards (boost/etc.) -- Another redditor gave some info on converting to 26"" wheels and was looking at 135mm hubs and from Surly, ""The stock Bridge Club comes with a 141mm hub and boost crankset, so one thing to keep in mind when switching to 135mm is that you would need a non-boost crankset: buying the stock listed crankset won't give ideal chainline."" So a boost crankset is necessary?   


Thanks ahead for any help! 

Update:
Surly wrote back and confirmed that square taper can be used in the bb shell (I'm not as familiar with the new bb standards, only square taper), so there are many options via that route. I guess this should have been obvious, as Cues is square taper apparently, from what I'm now seeing.
However, a few options have been shared by others that seem really interesting, mostly Aerozine, which have nonboost, boost, and superboost cranksets in a wide variety of lengths (and length ranges with adjustability), with narrow q factors.

The new bike is the same bike just with rim brakes instead and is 1100€ new with warranty and all that fun stuff. Straight from the manufacturer.

My thoughts I feel like getting a bike with discs is more future proof and easier to sell if need be down the road. Of course the risk is how used it is and no warranty. But it looks well kept in photos.

New bike. Loses value as soon as you walk out the door. Not sure how hot rim brakes will be for resale. But the benefits are it’s new, warranty, and no thinking about what could be wrong.

My previous bike was a Cannondale Supersix Evo from 2017, size 58, which ended up being too large for me. I don’t want that to happen again.

* Moderately upright hardtail 29"" MTB geometry
* Sliding or modular dropouts (for running single speed)
* Frame or dropout split for belt drive (for future upgrade)
* Within around $2000 for full build
* Available in Europe

Of course, most complete bikes that fit the lightness and dropout requirements are much more expensive (closer to $4000), partially because they have such premium build kits. But I'd consider getting the frameset and building it as single speed to keep initial costs down, then making upgrades over the years.

So far, nothing in my research fits the bill, so I'm leaning toward just settling for the 2024 Kona Unit, which would become my clunker until I can afford to build or buy something more like the above.

1708436117.0,Please help me decide how to get better gearing for hills,"Hi everyone, advice sought on gearing options for my new (to me) bike. Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

I recently bought a second hand Cannondale CAADX to use as a road bike that can handle the appallingly bad quality of British roads / the odd bit of light gravel and canal towpaths. Current set up is 1x 11speed, with a 40t front cog and a 11-32t cassette. Rear derailleur is Shimano 105 R5800, medium cage. 

I live in a hilly area and whilst I can manage most climbs ok, I do find myself wanting something slightly easier. I regularly need to ride up 10%+ gradients. Options I have considered:

1. Replace the cassette with an 11-36t, which I believe my current derailleur should be able to handle (it's out of spec but plenty of people report it working fine). It gives me an extra climbing gear (ration of 1.11, vs current 1.25) whilst keeping the jumps between teeth manageable at the lower end.

2. Replace the cassette with an 11-40t, and probably get a new derailleur (e.g. GRX 812), or try using a derailleur extender, like WolfTooth roadlink. Gives me an even easier climbing gear, but bigger jumps in teeth at the other end. Possibly too big?

3. Move to 2x, and get a front derailleur and new front cogs (probably 44 / 34, or similar). This will basically give me an extra gear at either end. It also means more flexibility to fine tune the gearing, but I have been enjoying not having to think about front shifting.

I don't mind spinning out on the descents too much, as I've little interest in racing or group riding. The simplicity of 1x also appeals to me.

Costs for these options all seem to be broadly similar. So what would you choose? My gut says option 1 (as it's the most straightforward), but I don't want to change cassette only to find I *still* want more teeth!

For comparison, my tourer/commuter bike is set up as with 42t/28t on the front, and 11-36t on the back. That low gear really comes in handy when loaded, but is a bit excessive the rest of the time.",cycling,2024-02-20 13:35:17

In mine (Spain), prices vary a lot. You can join the typical small local event for around 40€, more expensive ones can cost around 70-80€ (usually these one include a jersey) and then you got the most famous ones that can cost around 120-150€.

So I've narrowed down my choices to two endurance bikes.

2nd option: Merida Scultura Endurance 6000

This also has Shimano 105 but Di2 so electronic shifting. Same carbon frame but comes with some generic wheelset.

The price is almost the same for both bikes, my question is would you go for electronic shifting and compromise on the wheelset? Or go for canyon with mechanical shifting but with DT Swiss wheels and hubs.

Last fall we would regularly ride 20-40 miles on the weekend. Usually with some elevation but nothing too crazy and always a cafe stop. I feel very fortunate to be with someone with similar hobbies and interests! We also run together. We’re of similar running speeds, but she doesn’t quite have the quads of a cyclist. So often I find myself in zone 1 and freewheeling to let her catch up. 

Lately I’ve been upping my cycling volume quite a bit and I’m really happy with my progress. The problem is that I want to include her on the long weekend rides without sacrificing too much of the opportunity for training. As those weekend rides seem to be pretty important for accumulating volume.

Is there a way for me to make things a bit harder on myself such that I’m getting a bit more zone 2 while staying at her speed? 

Some ideas I’ve had are using my heavier TT bike and just not ride in the aero position. I could also carry more weight. At the very least, I want to teach her how to draft off me so she can go faster while putting in less effort.

1708397191.0,Recommendation for tubless carbon wheels with brass nipples,"I'm looking for some carbon wheels with brass nipples to use for riding near the beach. Aesthetically, UD matte and 3k weave would be great.

1708395318.0,Planning to build up for an ultra solo long ride,"Not sure whether this sounds ultra to you, but definitely to me.

I would like to do a ride over 500 km and about 4,000 m total ascent according to Garmin. Finishing it in 24 hours (without sleep) seems to be a local challenge and I want to try in this summer, maybe August.

I generally ride 150 km with 1500 m total ascent during weekends in summer, and I will feel strong fatigue after that. So, I am guessing I need a large volume of Zone 2 to further build up my aerobic ability. Besides, I am not lightweight with BMI 24.2 and 15% body fat (might be not accurate), so I want to lose some weight meaning I need calorie deficit. But it is a little tricky, as you all know we need to fuel ourselves well in cycling training. (PS: If I confused you, I am not planning to diet during the ride, but want to lose some pounds before I set off) Any more structured training advices?

Along the way, there are many small restaurants and convenient stores so I am not very nervous about fueling, and plan to ride with only two bottles, repair kits, and phone. It seems no problems here?",cycling,2024-02-20 02:15:18

1708393999.0,Advice on Bicycle Rack for Average 4 Door Sedan-Don't Want to ruin the Paint on Car,"Long story short... Got smoked by a truck around a year ago while riding.  Wife, family, friends, doctors, etc told me it's crazy to ride on the roads here. In the ER I was told that they see this happen too often. Anyways, it all got in my head and I haven't been on a bike since. Post PT, I have been working on the anxiety and fear etc, but the amount of weight I've gained since not having my daily routine has really gotten me thinking about how I can hop on the saddle again.  My wife and I agreed that riding on bike paths off of the road would be safe enough. There is a good one near me, but it's about 3 or 4 miles away and it's all busy streets to get there. Solution is buying a bike rack for the car to transport my bike to the path so I can start riding again. Or at least see if I can do it.  


Looking for advice on an affordable but functioning bike rack that won't damage the car. Ideally with a capacity of two bikes. It's for an average 4 door sedan. For a road bike and/or trail bike.

Any rec's would be greatly appreciated; it's been a long year and I'm trying to get back to at least a little bit of what I used to love to do.

1708392916.0,Question from tubeless newbie,"I have tubeless tires on a road bike (or any bike) for the first time. Had them installed Friday, rode Saturday and Monday, and back tire lost significant air pressure each time. Didn't go flat, but I could tell at end of ride that it was noticeably less inflated than front tire just by using my hand to test it.  After today's ride, I re-inflated to 80, and after 4 hours, it is significantly down again.

I understand this is not uncommon with new installs and sometimes will fix itself on its own, although after listening to what I just typed I think I know the answer.  But  should I try again, or take it back to shop ASAP to have them address it?

I need to pick up a new wheelset for this coming race season. (My current carbon brake track is worn and I don't have money for training/racing dedicated wheelsets ATM).

The plan is to race one more season on my rim brake bike before building a new bike next year (with discs).  I don't want to shell out top dollar on a wheelset I don't plan to keep long term so what would you do?

Budget is fairly low but considering new Elite wheels SLT, or an Ican wheelset... But I also found a deal on a slightly used set of HED Jet 6 plus wheels for the same price.

New carbon, new hubs plus a warranty would be nice but wouldn't be the end of the world. Can't seem to work toward a conclusion...

1708387007.0,Location Scouting in Switzerland,"I'm setting up a ride camp for some buddies of mine to Switzerland this summer, targeting the first week of July. I've been to Switzerland before (based out of the US), but haven't done a ton of riding there, so I've been doing a ton of research (I'm generally pretty good at doing these things, even for places I haven't been).

I know for sure I want to do the Andermatt region to see the main highlights like the Gotthardpass, Nufenenpass, Furka, Grimsel, Susten, and even the Klausenpass (if possible - it's a bit further out from Andermatt), but I want to target a second location as well. We have maybe somewhere around 10 days in total to consider here.

I was hoping the second location would be something slightly different, so going to Lugano has been my plan. I rode in Como a few years back and it was amazing. But there's another spot that PJAMM's site says is one of the best climbs in the world - the Männlichen / Grosse Schiedegg from Grindelwald (riding in the ""shadow of the Eiger"" sounds epic as hell).

Problem is that to get to it from Andermatt requires a longer ride (like 200km+) or a transfer to Interlaken (I could also do this section of the trip first). But this makes planning for Lugano trickier as well, considering it a 3 1/2 hour train transfer between both locations.

Anyone here have personal experience with this region who can recommend if the Männlichen is worth the extra effort here if you're already doing the others out of Andermatt? I've considered axing the Lugano side in favor something more towards Interlaken or maybe Les Diablerets, but my main concern there is that it may potentially feel more similar to the other climbs than Lugano would.

I’m wondering your thoughts on getting something like a truewerk t4 or carhart bib for cycling. I think base layers for the top of the body are easy, but I don’t have much for pants.

1708374897.0,Buyers beware - Ascend spin bikes and customer service,"Sharing my experience with **Ascend and their S2 Magnetic Spin Bike**. 

I'm new to spin bikes and wanted to get something more affordable to figure out if this was something I wanted to get into - looked into a couple companies and found one based in Canada and boasts about their customer service being based in Canada (and I wanted to support local). 

My S2 magnetic spin bike has been making a whopping sound since the first day I got it, and have since been in a runaround with their customer service to get it exchanged.  They initially offered an exchange or discount, then after 1.5 months of follow ups on my end, they deemed it to not be defective and it will cost me shipping plus 10-30% handling fees on top for an exchange. 

Honestly if they told me from the get go that this sound is normal, I would've chalked it up to maybe I'm being picky about the noise.  But after they offered the exchange and gave me a runaround for a month to then tell me it's not defective and will not be honouring **their own offer** of exchange or discount, I am incredibly disappointed in this company. 

When I was researching Ascend and their spin bikes, I couldn't find many reviews other than their website, so I hope this will help someone that may have been looking to purchase their equipment.  I wrote a review about my experience but it didn't get posted so it seems like they only post good reviews on their site anyways...

**Timelines:** 

Jan 2, 2024: First ride after I set up my bike, it is making a whopping sound so I contacted customer service with a video 

Jan 11, 2024: Ascend offered exchange or discount as a resolution.  I opted for exchange as the whopping sound was bugging me. 

Jan 15: Follow up, no response

Jan 22: Follow up, no response

Jan 30, 2024: Ascend responded saying they will send an email with return label and will set up a date for courier to pick up.  No return label or courier was sent. 

Feb 4: Follow up, asking for discount instead cause I no longer wanted to wait for an exchange while a huge box has been sitting in living room for 1 month (they said I had to keep the box in order to exchange the item).  No response. 

Feb 15: Ascend responded they have now deemed the bike non-defective, and if I want an exchange it is on my dollar to cover the shipping fees plus 10-30% handling fees. ",cycling,2024-02-19 20:34:57

1708374063.0,Cannot set a comfortable handlebar position,"Hi!

I’ve been trying to properly set my handlebar (hood specifically - I just feel safe when my fingers are on the brake), but it’s never comfortable. The only comfortable position is when I grip on the tip of the shifter (the top 2-3cm pointing upwards), and holding it like if I would grip something vertically, pushing myself away from the bike. It’s very comfortable, but not too safe.

The other bike fit positions out of the book (yes, I’ve been to a bike fit, didn’t work out) are very uncomfortable, I also tried to decrease reach, and drop to have a more upright position, and I made the saddle point upwards for better balance and less weight on hands, but no luck.

With the recommended handlebar positions feel like I’m pushing myself up with my arms, and it’s causing thumb pain (with “straight wrists” you’re pretty much holding yourself with your thumb), and pain/compression at the base of palm, where it connects to the wrist. 

It may seem weird and contradictory, but I was actually thinking about getting clip on aero bars.

I’m with a small Boardman ADV 9.0, GRX group set (105 160mm crankset), 36cm wide handlebars, and trying out a wide range of stems from 7deg 90mm, 70mm, and 30deg 60mm.

I was a competitive rower in high school who had dreams of college recruitment but was busted due to injury. This plunged me into depression for the past 3 years. Went to college and now am I graduating senior at 23. I raced xc mtb through middle school and cross trained a lot on the bike while rowing. Naturally, I turned to triathlon to try to get over the depression caused by rowing but soon realized I hated swimming and running. Joined a club last summer and went on recreational ""I have no idea what I'm doing"" rides 2-3 times a week. Got my first zwift setup and account 3-4 weeks ago and completed one race which enforced me in B ( don't really what that means ). It also says my ftp is \~3.7 w/kg ( again don't know the significance of that ).

That being said, I have always loved the erg ( until I couldn't do it ) even more than the water. I have always liked training on ""erg mode"" whether it be on the erg or the bike. Frankly, I often love indoors more than outdoors. I'm a relatively ""heavy"" guy for road ( 78-80 kg ). 3 years ago, I was squatting close to 400lb and bulgarian squatting 315 lb reps. Stopped lifting since so I'm not even sure I could yank 225lb ! Zwift recorded my 5 sec ""sprint"" to be 16-17 w/kg. Due to all this, I was recommended to give track a shot and see if it could fill the void of rowing/ help me on the path of mental recovery.

I enjoy riding fast on road and I’m after a bike that could have clearance for gravel tyres. My riding will be predominantly road riding but I’d like to have the option to explore gravel.

I don’t race, mostly ride solo or with friends on group rides. I’m Melbourne (Australia) based so riding near me is a mix of flats/rolling hills and some climbs (nothing crazy) with smooth gravel trails as options. 
I won’t be bikepacking or doing any MTB trail standard gravel.

I’d like advice on group sets/brands/tyre clearance, etc best suited for this type of riding. I’m currently on an old rim brake cervelo ultegra 50/39 which has served me well. 

An endurance frame suits my body shape with the shorter reach and I mainly do long coastal rides 40 - 100km+. 
Checklist for a new bike is:
- electronic groupset (105 & Ultegra + SRAM equivalents is fine)
- Hydraulic disc brake
- Tyre clearance 32mm+ (35mm for gravel?)
- Endurance geometry 
- Budget of $8/9k AUD max

Current gearing suits me fine I would maybe try 52t otherwise I won’t need any higher for my riding.

Stand out option for me is the Canyon Endurace but keen to hear if there are other options people have tried that might be better? Wilier Rave SL appeals to me too.

Could I be looking at gravel bikes + road gearing and wheels (cervelo aspero/Scott addict gravel/Cannondale super six CX/canyon grail)?

1708319779.0,Why don’t they make practical bikes any more?,"By “practical bikes” I mean bikes built for everyday transportation like a Raleigh Sports: comfortable riding position with North Road/albatross bars, shipped with fenders, braze-ons for racks, chain guards, internal hubs etc.

Instead, all the major brands pump out flat-bar hybrids marketed as “fitness” bikes that don’t really do anything well, are no fun to ride, and are not practical for transportation unless you buy a bunch of accessories (fenders, racks, lights).

There are a handful of niche brands making bikes like this, you could import something from Europe, or you could build up your own, but none of those options are going to appeal to the vast majority of people who might be interested in bikes like these.

With all the improvements in cycling infrastructure in many places over the last 10+ years, it seems like there would be a market in the US for a modern, $1,200 version of a 1960s utility bike.

Edit: For the record, I've ridden bikes for 35 years for pleasure and the last 20 for transportation. I currently have a road bike, a mountain bike, a fixed gear, and a utility bike like what I'm describing that I built up myself from an old Schwinn frame.

[https://road.cc/content/review/68959-ritchey-wcs-c260-degree-stem](https://road.cc/content/review/68959-ritchey-wcs-c260-degree-stem)

To try and avoid clutter on the bars, I purchased an alloy out-front mount like this to support my Garmin above and a front light below:

[https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07PM2HYRW](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07PM2HYRW)

All seemed fine with my plan until I went to fit it and looked in more detail at the stem.

Firstly, It has a 270 degree wrap to the main section, with the front plat that contains the bars only wrapping about 90 degrees. This alone shouldn't be a problem though on its own as the mount has angle adjustment options.

What I noticed though the moment I looked more closely (see image in top link) is that the screws on the stem screw in from back to front - i.e. the back part is not threaded, only the front is (and even if it was possible, fitting it to the back would put it in a position way too far back). Further to this, the longer screws supplied with the mounts are also too fat to fit through the holes here.

Does anyone have any ideas for other options I could be looking at for fitting both Garmin and lamp to the stem neatly? If it comes to it, I'm not that averse to swapping the stem (this is a 10+ year old design afterall), but would want to be certain that any new one would definitely work with however I was going to mount things.

Also - it seems I'm not the only one to come across this problem with Ritchey stems:

Eventually I did take 3 months completely off the bike… I was in hospital for something unrelated. Since then I have had no end to the knee issues. Now, this past year, I have quite a bit of pain in both knees after about 60 min at hard riding. In October of last year I did something to my right knee. It just felt like a hard ride but the next day it was making a clicking noise and it has been pretty sensitive ever since. Sometimes a sharp twinge type pain and sometimes just a dull pain around the kneecap. I’ve mostly stopped riding the road bike but still ride to get around as I do not own a car. I’m going to physio and was informed that I have weak damaged cartilage (I had an MRI this time and it came back clear). I’ve also been doing a lot of stretching and exercises as prescribed but  without much improvement. I absolutely love my sport and I’m pretty upset about the whole situation. I have tried every position imaginable as well as changing my cranks to 155mm.  I have also had 2 bike fits (one a few years ago and one in September 2023). All with minimal improvement. I’m getting to the point that I’m forced to consider leaving the sport. Wondering if others have had similar experiences and if there was anything that helped them?

1708280005.0,Mounting tolerances Shimano crank set,"Hi!
Lately I changed my Shimano FC-6700 53-38T crank for a FC-6700 50-34T crank on my Canyon Endurance road bike.
While mounting the 50-34T version I proceeded as recommended in the original Shimano installation guide.
After putting on the left crank and tightening the crank nut to calibrate the left crank position on the Hollowtech 2 shaft I noticed that there is a gap of approximatly 3 to 3.5mm between left crank and pressfit bearing.

I do not remember seeing such a big gap ever before on a bike and wonder what could be the reason?
In my opinion riding the bike like this would result in some axial movement of the shaft and therefore changing positions of pedals and distances between chain and front derraileur.

I'm aware that mountainbikes sometimes use spacers for pressfit bearings in order to adjust the chainline to the rear derailleur but never heard of anything similar for road bikes..

Any advice? Or recommendations?

Thank you very much!",cycling,2024-02-18 18:13:25
1708279555.0,"New Road Surface Map Overlay For Europe, North America, & Australia!","Hello, I'm part of the team of three roommates who've been developing a completely free alternative cycling routing service, similar to Strava's route builder/Kommot/RideWithGPS over the past year, [https://sherpa-map.com](https://sherpa-map.com).

Our latest addition is a stunning overlay showcasing what road is what surface type for all of North America, Europe (plus some area around Europe), and Australia from Open Street Map + AI classified data!

You can access this at the bottom of the interface, by simply pressing the ""Show Overlay"" button.

Black: Paved  
Gray: Gravel  
Brown/reddish color: Dirt  
Tan: Unpaved (misc category that doesn't fit the above)

This can be overlaid on a variety of different map types, including OSM/Google/Terrain/Mapbox, etc.

Not only did it take months of effort to create a pipeline to properly generate this, but the other mentioned source, using AI classification, has been an ongoing research and development effort, that's even prompted us to purchase a whole new workstation in addition to numerous server upgrades (this project has been, well, heating our apartment basement).

This system works by using satellite images of roads that lack a classification, are not primary, or in a town (I've defaulted those to paved), I then get a 640x640 satellite image and use a deeplabv3\_resnet101 classifier to segment out/pull be the best 240x240 image of the road out of the image, and use a resenet152 classifier I trained to determine if it is paved/unpaved, then an additional classifier to determine if the unpaved is gravel/dirt/unpaved. It will only accept the classification if it's above a 95% confidence level. I've managed this so far with the American states of Wisconsin/Illinois/Minnesota/Iowa, and will keep on classifying (I've also recompiled our routing software to match)!

I'm planning on implementing a right-click mechanism to allow users to instantly update to correct surface types if they find an issue. I'm also working on adding this data to our very own map tiles, which are in the works.

  
I aim to keep updating and working on this; if you have any suggestions, or requests for location (I'd be happy to add your region), just let us know in the comments.

I have a road bike for commutes and training, but ride the CX to the shops and random other trips. I was going along the Mersey path in South Manchester where they have built a short cut across a field, except the start has a wooden lip at an angle in the asphalt. I was obviously not paying enough attention (or it shouldn't be there in the first place,) my front wheel railed along the damp wood and I was thrown off on my left hand side. 

I was winded, ripped my knee on my jeans with a big scrape, a magic scrape on my elbow, passing straight through my jacket and hoodie, and a mahoosive heart-shaped bruise on the back side of my thigh. I am still sore now on Sunday, and looking out the window at the weather and wishing I was good to ride as Sod's Law, it will be raining again by next weekend. I am already 350km behind last years total due to the weather and having to move flat/apartment. But as a friend told me it is *only* February.

I just wonder how many times I can sustain something like this and just pop up only bruised? I go so far that a future crash seems inevitable, even if it is a few years away.

I created a searchable functional fitness exercise database in Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets for personal trainers and fitness coaches, but I think that it would be a useful tool for strength and conditioning to supplement your cycling training. I also posted this in the r/personaltraining subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/personaltraining/s/BI4l6Bs9W0) and it seemed to be helpful - I thought I’d share with this community as well. 

It is time consuming to sift through all the exercise information available on the internet (multiple exercise databases, YouTube videos, fitness pages/social media), so I made this to have all of the data in one spreadsheet that can be quickly filtered for your exercise search. The database has more than 25 search filters available for over 1200 + functional exercises - allowing you to find the information you need in seconds when designing fitness programs or learning new movement patterns. 

The fitness library also includes exercises using the barbell, dumbbells, kettlebells, gymnastics rings, parallette bars, calisthenics, clubbells, indian clubs, maces, the landmine attachment, suspension trainer, sliders and other functional equipment that you may not have used for your current workouts. All exercises requiring you to move, stabilize, and develop functional and pain free strength.

It has been a fun project for me to chip away at when I’m not training, so please give it a try and let me know your thoughts!

Eventually the battery in the strap died and long story short I ruined the housing and killed it while trying to pry the damn thing open (factory sealed).  I threw it away thinking that I could just replace it.  Imagine my surprise when I started looking and realized the industry has moved on to bigger, fancier, app/bluetooth based heart rate monitors  (won't work with the 910lc) with all kinds of amazing features that i don't need, and my chest strap was discontinued and gone.

1708222035.0,"Bike fitter recommended shorter and flipped stem for comfort, wanting to try to build flexibility instead","I’m a newbie road biker who recently bought a Tarmac SL6 with the intention of going after performance and eventually doing TTs and road races. I don’t have any prior experience riding a drop bar. Naturally, I lack the flexibility to hold a good posture and look slightly stretched on the bike (locked elbows, but the frame fits me otherwise). But I’m still pretty young and don’t necessarily mind a bit of discomfort either. 

My bike fitter recommended a shorter stem (80mm vs 100mm), with a positive rise to reduce reach and build more comfort. While this does feel comfortable indoors on a trainer in a static position, on the road I feel crammed and the bike feels twitchy. But the upright posture does reduce light pains in lower back and neck. 

My question is, can I ignore this advice and hope to develop more flexibility after more hours on the saddle in a more uncomfortable but a better position from a performance perspective? Or should I stick to the comfort advice and spend a season or two with this?

I’m adding more Yoga and Stretching to aid with flexibility, and already have a strength training routine to help too (ironically, sore muscles after compound lifts don’t aid with flexibility). With the more comfortable position (positive and shorter stem), I don’t get the same feel of a performance road bike anymore, as it’s fairly upright and feels very much like an endurance/gravel bike posture. The handling is also not very confident inspiring. With the lower down position, I definitely find it hard to sustain for long intervals but can build up to it slowly, especially as I get to ride more as the riding season starts.

Do think the bike fitters advice is valid but find a bit of misalignment with my goals and determination to put the work in.",cycling,2024-02-18 02:07:15

1708200244.0,Turbo Trainer or Spin Recco Request - $2k budget,"Long post inbound, summary bullets below for the TLDR.

Looking for advice/recommendations from those familiar or that have gone down a similar path. I am in the market for an indoor trainer after recovering from an injury that knocked me out of cardio for nearly the last year--with current situations, outdoor riding is not an option.

My local gym has shared peloton bikes which both my spouse and I enjoy, which comes with the inconvenience of shared access/sweat of public use without guaranteed access when trying to stick to a schedule. I also have the guide membership and regardless of end choice, will be maintaining the peloton guide membership for the availability of classes.

I also have an old mag trainer that my Giant Escape sits on for use on the days I want to ride but don't have the patience to get ready and potentially not get one of the gym bikes or have to wait it out for who knows how long. The setup 'works', albeit sounds like a jet engine at speed and I'm fine making it work for peloton app classes or tacx/ride and watch TV.

Now that we are through the background BS...my original plan was to pickup a refurbished peloton bike+ for use at home, as I have been curious about the ERG mode and my spouse also enjoys spin, with a quick changeover between the two of us. The refurb runs $2k without a sale, which is easy to stomach as a QOL/health improvement purchase. My concern is financial security of peloton for how closed system it is, and if I was going to invest the $$ I'd rather examine the best use of cash to not lock myself into a closed brand that I'd have to get creative with if the company goes under. Since I have the Escape and don't mind shifting gears to estimate my own resistance (which will be even easier with a power meter), I've also been looking at smart trainers to make better use of my cash and get a more realistic experience. Love climb rides and powerzone, as well as simulated gradients of real world tours.

Current Equipment:

* Giant Escape w/ SPD pedals (large frame)
* Elite mag trainer, loud as hell, not direct drive, click wheel adjustments (\~4 years old, decent wear)
* Garmin Epix 2 / Fenix 7s Pro

Goals:

* Cardiovascular Health (Build health/strength back up for outdoor riding)
* FTP Improvements / Duration of Rides
* Sustained power outputs/Endurance

Requirements:

* Silent / Minimum Noise (bike chain only/gear shifting is fine)
* \~$2k budget
* Warranty (ideally 2 year, 1 year's ok..)
   * Not really looking for second hand
* Can sync with Garmin (currently using P2G for peloton to garmin, works great)
* ERG

Nice To Have:

* Compatible for 6' and 5'4'' individuals
* Rocker plates/roadfeel
* Ant+ and Bluetooth broadcast
* Grade simulation

Models of Interest:

* Peloton Bike+ Refurb
* Garmin Neo 3M (family is in the garmin ecosystem currently...)
   * Maybe Neo 2T + rockers? 
* Wahoo Kicker 6 or Move
* Truekinetix 6.2 or 8.2

To make sure that I did not forget anything, I decided to request some feedback. 

Requirements/Circumstances:
- commuting (10-15km, 2-5 times a week) and every day trips, in total about 2500km/year
- mostly paved ways, but 'the last mile' to my home is pretty dirty, muddy and uneven
- bike must be compatible with a trailer, therefore I want an aluminum bike
- I don't own a car, so it is my main mobility device and must be kind of reliable


Those requirements actually scream: 'Go for a dad bike!!11', like with an integrated dynamo and lights etc. But I don't feel it. I don't want to go down this road (yet). I know this would be the sane decision, but hell, no <insert Michael Scott no gif here>.

https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/gravel-bikes/adventure/grizl/al/grizl-7-1by/3468.html?dwvar_3468_pv_rahmenfarbe=R075_P05

This thought has been in my mind for quite a long time now, but I could not bring myself to actually buy it yet.

Why the grizl? 
- I want a bike, that is kind of fast and reliable for everyday commuting
- I want to take it out for rides through the surrounding countryside
- I already own a road bike, so the grizl would cover a different area
- I could use it for bike camping 

What I am still unsure about: 
1x12 or 2x11?
The trend seems to be in favor of the 1x12/13, but I am unsure. I am used to 2x11 and have no problem with it and it seems to be better for e.g. bike camping tours, but I am happy to hear any other advice or experience with it. 

So, do my thoughts make any sense? What would you go for? I still hesitate since my current budget bike still works but I dont really want to wait for it to finally break down :/",cycling,2024-02-17 17:03:25
1708187918.0,Having a hard time breaking from the hoods,"I'm in the process of buying a new bike but I'm unsure of which one to pick.

I've now narrowed it down to two bikes which are:

Liv Devote 0 - https://www.liv-cycling.com/gb/devote-0-2024

Liv Thrive Advanced 1 - 
https://www.bike24.com/p2710422.html

I got a proper bike fit at the shop, they were set up for me and I tested them both.

I enjoy them both but I really love the feel of the Devote. I have one big problem compared to the Thrive tho. I'm rather small with small hands and have a hard time breaking from the hoods. I can break but it feels like I don't have the same amount of stopping power that I get from my normal flat handle bar bike/compared to the Thrive. I feel like I won't be able to come to a full stop/emergency break from the hoods at all, is that normal and I have to get used to it? I want to use it for long rides but also for commuting which would make fast stops a necessity. Will this only be possible from the drops? 

All in all I dont know if I just need some time getting used to it/more grip strength etc. but it makes me a bit concerned and I don't feel as safe. I enjoy riding the Devote a lot but I don't want to regret spending 2k on a bike I'm too afraid to use in the end. Maybe someone has some advice.",cycling,2024-02-17 16:38:38

1708171371.0,Hip rotation on and off the saddle,"Hey folks, this question is about the proper position of the hip while sitting on the saddle and while sprinting off the saddle.
To the why:

Due to growing fast I grew kinda crooked which ultimately lead to bad postures and chronic pain. I'm in my mid twenties now and have to relearn a lot of basics about my body, movement and postures, and I'm doing good progress. I'm cycling a lot, but I still have no proper feeling how my hip position should be in certain movements and I'm questioning my position on the bike. Maybe this is just mentally and I'm doing alright, but I gotta know, you know?


If you can give any insight, or have a link to a great article I would be very happy to dive into it. When I try to find anything related on Google the results I get are more in the direction of bike fitting , but my concern is really just the rotation of the hip, and how the muscles should work while cycling.
Should angle of the hip be like a straight extension of the spine. Should you do a hollow back like in dead lifting.
Should you alternate between different angles of the hip during a tour, but then what about sprinting, where the forces are higher? Do you actively use the core muscles while pedaling, or will the muscles do the job as long as you train them properly outside of cycling.
You see I have a lot of questions.

I already spoke to my Physio and bike fitter about this, but it appears this type of question doesn't come often or is weird,  anyway I was turned down with short answers from both.

1708170294.0,I am sick of this sub glorifying 'bike fits'. 95% of cyclists don't need one.,"Most people do not need a bike fit. Most cyclists do less than 2 hours a week for leisure and travel, fitting a bike for this is not hard
Step 1. Look on the manufacturers website that tells you what size bike is suitable for your height
Step 2. Adjust saddle height
Job done.

IF you cycle for more than 2 hours a week I would advise you watch a YouTube video about getting a good saddle height. That is it, that is all you need for 95% of cyclists. 

So what about the remaining 5%? These are people who are on the bike for many hours a week commuting or racing or training. Like anything that you do for long periods of time you need to get yourself in the best possible position to avoid straining or injuring yourself. Put serious effort into getting your bike set up correctly and aligned to you. Either watch many YouTube videos or IF you have spare cash and someone you trust then get a bike fit.

1708155994.0,Help with upgrading my bike,"Hello. On mobile so pls excuse formatting and spelling.  Am a 42 year old male and i picked up a hybrid (decathlon triban 100 7 speed which has been rock solid) a few years ago.

 Been using it to commute and doing rides between 20 and 50 kms every other week. I'm just under 6'2 and my hybrid is a size smaller (size 54) so I have been looking to get a bigger one and thought why not upgrade while I'm at it. Very difficult to find one the right size, in the 2nd hand market in the country where I am.  

Considering 2 options:

1. 2nd hand cannondale super 6 evo hi mod for $1,300 (2016-2017 model , 56 cms) Has sram red 10 speed shifter, rim brakes. Comes with  low quality wheels, bar and saddle so that will need to be upgraded along with new pedals. 
It's pretty aggressive geometry and I definitely don't intend to race (maybe the odd amateur event for fun). Intend to do endurance rides mainly. 

2. New entry level gravel bike (from a bike shop where I know the people well) Specialized, giant, trek, etc. which i can order in my size. 8 speed Claris groupset, aluminum frame, disc brakes. Brand new will cost approx the same as the cannondale (approx $1,400) But more comfortable geometry and maybe better for comfort. 

Cannondale is tempting given carbon fiber , groupset and bling factor. But it's old and I will probably need new wheels, bars and saddle.  As I write this I'm starting to lean towards getting a brand new gravel bike. Seems less of a hassle and if I feel I really deserve it I can always sell it and upgrade after a few years .

I wrote Lauf today and told them I was looking for a bike I could do long distance touring with and also endurance riding.  They responded back that the Uthald would fit the bill, but I'm a little skeptical because the stack to reach ratio on the Uthald is 1.48 whereas my Domane's stack to reach is 1.67.   Also, the Uthald doesn't have any fender or rack mounts.  However, I know that Lauf has also relaxed the stack angle and done some other things with the frame that make it more comfortable.  I would love to hear feedback from anyone who has actually ridden it.  Even better would someone who has ridden both the Uthald and the Domane.  Thanks in advance!

I am looking for people willing to test my hobby project. It's a free browser application that allows you to ride your (or other players) recorded activities with your Bluetooth trainer.

It's called [E-Keirin](https://ekeirin.rubbercu.be/) (https://ekeirin.rubbercu.be/) and is still very rough; but I am curious to know if people enjoy riding with it. (You don't have to connect it to strava; you can ride the available tracks.)

Current key-features are:

* 3D visualization of your ride
* Multiplayer riding
* Slope simulation for trainers
* Strava activity upload
* Strava track import from activity

I know there is still plenty of work to do. I am planning on having support for more devices. I will obviously improve the rather rough looking 3D visualization. I am also thinking of supporting various race modes (that's where the name e-keirin originates from).

Technical notes: I've tested it with a Wahoo Kickr Core with Chrome. Firefox does not support Bluetooth; Mobile platforms don't work either (yet).

1708106411.0,Am I dumb for wanting to Upgrade my Bike?,"So I bought a 1999 Cannondale R800 CAAD3 off Facebook Marketplace recently. It seems like the original owner hardly rode it at all, or at least took really great care of it. The drivetrain is Shimano 105. The crankset is FC-1056 and everything else is 1056 as well. 

The crankset and cassette are in excellent shape, and the chain isn’t stretched at all. The derailleurs work well, and the only thing is the brifters were a little gummed up, but I fixed that. 

I have the parts to swap to a more modern 10 speed drivetrain. 10 speed Shimano Ultegra CS-6700 Cassette and an 11 speed shimano ultegra R8000 crankset. Microshift Arsis Derailleurs and Brifters (2015). And the bottom bracket for the crankset. I already made sure that the parts will all fit onto the bike.

Is it ridiculous that I’m swapping a perfectly good 8speed drivetrain for a new 10 speed?

I have an old Fuji mountain bike (it’s actually a Marlboro adventure team bike from the program where you sent in cigarette boxes for prizes in the 90s) and could just swap my 8speed drive train onto that bike and turn it into a gravel bike of sorts.

I’ve only recently really gotten into cycling so don’t kill me if I’m committing some egregious sin

1708095045.0,Looking to upgrade road bike / advice welcome 😇,"Hi everyone :) I am 40F, relatively new in the world of road cycling (started in late 2021 while recovering from a running injury) and looking to upgrade from my 2016 endurance road bike Felt ZW4 Disc. In short, it feels like a dated entry level carbon bike with unreliable mech disc brakes and relatively heavy at 8,8kg.

I am mostly riding with a local cycling club and we live in a hilly area, so the usual rides are 60-100km/600-1200m ascend.

I live in Germany, and will be buying via job leasing, so looking into best buy German brands such as Canyon, Rose or even Cube makes sense to me. I am not excluding other manufacturers, they just seem to offer similar components for 20-30% more money.

My budget is between 3000-3500/absolute max 4000 EUR.

Electronic shifting is not necessary and if I could I would look for mech Ultegra or comparable.

I have also been suffering from Long Covid since February 2022 and it has been mostly affecting my ability to do high intensity in training (read: climbs). While I am quite decent on flat and during running, I suffer during climbs, so I absolutely need easier gears (I had to change cassette and consequently rear derrailleur on my current Felt from 11-32 to 11-34 105 and it has made a visible positive difference). This hasn’t improved with training one bit (because it’s a pathological process, not deconditioning), so I don’t expect this to improve and have to count that in. I don’t want an E-bike.

This throws me in the direction of endurance bikes, but I don’t want a slow, upright, heavy bike, too (as I already have that with current Felt lol). So probably either looking into race-ier/lighter endurance bikes or a race bike that I can easily and not too expensively change the cassette later. I don’t mind riding in a sportier position, but most race bikes come with 10-28 or 10-30 cassette, which is way too demanding gearing for my Long Covid. Ofc, bigger cassette will increase weight in a race bike.

What do you think makes more sense?

These are some of my picks, all advice is welcome, as long as it fits into my budget, needs and location.

CANYON:

Probably best buy would be [Endurace CF SLX 7 AXS](https://www.canyon.com/en-de/road-bikes/endurance-bikes/endurace/cf-slx/endurace-cf-slx-7-axs/3087.html?dwvar_3087_pv_rahmenfarbe=BK%2FBK) with revamped, race-ier geometry, 10-36 cassette, powermeter and Sram Rivat eTap at 3800 EUR, though it is not the lightest at 8,7kg and seems sold out in my size XS.

Their old geometry endurance bike [Endurace CF 8 Di8](https://www.canyon.com/en-de/road-bikes/endurance-bikes/endurace/cf/endurace-cf-8-di2/3709.html)with the new Ultegra 2x12 and a 11-34 cassette at 3800 EUR, also seems decent, though also heavy at 8,4kg

[Their Ultimate series](https://www.canyon.com/en-de/road-bikes/race-bikes/ultimate/cf-sl/ultimate-cf-sl-7/3790.html) unfortunately will not fit my needs, as I can only afford entry level model with 105, which doesn’t seem like an upgrade big enough, both in terms of weight and groupset.

Rose:

Their bikes are much lighter than Canyon on the average and [Reveal 04 Ultegra Di2](https://www.rosebikes.de/rose-reveal-04-ultegra-di2-2702563) with 2x12, 11-34 cassette and at 7,6kg seems like just a thing for me, though it’s already above my budget at 4100 EUR and seems currently sold out in my size 53.

I don’t know whether it makes sense looking into [their race bike series Xlite](https://www.rosebikes.de/fahrr%C3%A4der/rennrad/race/xlite), which offers new Ultegra 2x12, but with 10-28 cassette, which is absolutely not enough for me and would needed to be changed…?

Cube:

This [AGREE C:62 RACE](https://www.cube.eu/de-de/cube-agree-c-62-race-carbon-n-black/d3c24ded01f0b52c27caca216a293153) with new Ultegra and 11-34 cassette at 3600 EUR sounds like a best buy, though it is not exactly the lightest at 8,3kg

Also this [AGREE C:62 PRO](https://www.cube.eu/de-de/cube-agree-c-62-pro-white-n-orange/aae3b2734cf09e10331a45c999db6ac0) with Sram Rival eTap and 10-36 cassette at 3200 EUR seems nice, but it’s definitely very heavy at 8,9kg.

Perhaps even this women specific [AXIAL WS C:62 SLX](https://www.cube.eu/de-de/cube-axial-ws-c-62-slx-team-ws/2a9b4a772237828d7453351421f96418) with the same Sram Rival eTap and 10-36 cassette at 3400 EUR and somewhat lighter at 8,5kg?

6) Is it worth converting tubeless even though it is quite an expensive job where I live?

Had a Giant Defy 1 (2013) and i remember it being quite comfortable (topped out at 35mile rides) I did feel like a sailing boat sail catching all the wind resistance and having to work harder than my friend to keep up)

If I'm going to be training and doing some shorter Tris and then topping out at ~56 miles, I find myself torn between endurance geometry and race.

I've managed to come across a couple of bikes that are slightly less extreme than their categories. The in-between bikes. 

Vitos Venom Aero Ultegra (wiggle have gone bust so there is that). Road and Gravel etc but the main thing I've picked out is it's s little more aggressive in the geometry than other 'endurance ' (read comfortable) bikes.

BMC Teammachine slr One (ultegra). Race slanted but its setup appears slightly more friendly than others in the category. 

Canyon Endurace is a bike I can't get my head around   'Fast' according to all reviews but the riding position looks like you are popping to the shops with your dog in the front basket. 

With a £5k budget,  hopefully you guys and gals can give me something to think about or suggestions to my problem. 

The new Defy, possibly more aggressive than old, but not on closer inspection. 

I do know 'try them' is the answer but I do need a shortlist so I know where to go.

1708082899.0,Shimano 105 drivetrain vibration/humming,"lately while on the home trainer (zwifthub) for a while say around 30-40min I am getting this very irritating vibration in my saddle that I am 99% sure is coming from my drivetrain, almost like a low hum. My front chainring is good (recently replaced) and my chain (KMC 11s) is in spec also checked. I am not completely incompetent with tools in my hands, I have have put together a few bikes, and can set and index gears. I am currently riding a Trek Emonda 2019 Disc 53-11 with 105 7000.

I have noticed it when I am on the road, but it is less of an issue because I get out the saddle more. It also tends to become more apparent when I moving a little faster, while seated.

I am thinking it has to do with chain deflection (not cross chaining) but on the stand when I back-peddle the chain almost catches on the rear cassette sometimes, although its not being pulled to one side by the derailer. I think it catches on that funny shaped Hyper Glide tooth, but hard to tell.

Any ideas of where this is coming from, or is this normal and I should just accept it?",cycling,2024-02-16 11:28:19
1708082538.0,High-end 25mm tyres or stock 28mm?,"So I recently upgraded my Carrera Zelos to a Triban RC520, and I am as happy as a pig in poo. The Zelos is sticking around as my turbo bike so I still have it. 

The craziest thing about my old Zelos is that it had a set of 25mm Continental GP5000s on there, probably worth significantly more than the bike - long story. 

The RC520 has the stock Resist Protect+ 28mm tyres on there. 

So the conundrum. The hive mind is pretty set these days that wider = better, but I've got a feeling that the contis are rather better tyres than the Triban's stock ones. But are they *that* much better that it's worth swapping to the thinner tyre? For info I'm built for comfort, not speed. Not a massive athlete and most cycling is done on good-ish paved roads. Budget is tight enough that I'm not going to be buying any other tyres, so it's one or the other. 

Any insight much appreciated 😊",cycling,2024-02-16 11:22:18

1708073935.0,Gears still slipping - what else to change / replace,"Hi,  


  
I posted a few weeks ago regarding this issue and I thought I had gotten to the bottom of it but it's reoccurring and wanted to see in anyone had some insights before I try and find a different bike shop – as the couple I’ve visited haven’t resolved the issue.  


  
Bike is still slipping out of gear, sometimes on hard effort , sometimes when changing gear. I’ve already done the following:

  
\-	Chain replaced.  
\-	Cassette replaced.  
\-	Cables replaced.   
\-	Indexed by shop and myself.

  
It’s like when you index it, it doesn’t hold or you can get some gears working but not others. As in I’ll be on my way want to use a certain gear – jump off and adjust tension seems fine but after a few gear changes its back to slipping. I could be wrong but it seems like it worse when changing gear in a certain direction up / down (I just cant think which way it is whilst I’m sat here).

  
Any ideas at all? It’s driving me nuts as the bikes usable, it’s just annoying.

1708067511.0,Ridiculous laws...,"So I normally don't ride a bike; just not in great health for it (not obesity!). Today the weather was good, my work is barely a mile away, and I felt up to it.

On the way to work I road the sidewalk where it was available, until an officer leaving a parking lot instructed me that bicycles belong in the road. Frankly I think it's foolish to put slow speed cyclists in a road with multi ton vehicles driven by inattentive drivers, but he's the law man. 

On the way home I was told by a different officer that I was impeding traffic and could be ticketed. I told him what I was told earlier and he responded that he doesn't make the laws. Ok. So wtf do I do? I was not ticketed for either, but it's a ridiculous paradox with deadly consequences. So to protect walkers from a slow speed bicycle we force bicyclists to compete with large metal objects traveling at 4+ times my speed? Cars don't want us in the road, and I don't want to be there! Then if I use an electric bike, now I'm operating an unlicensed motor vehicle even if I'm going the same speed as a regular bike? 

Sorry for rambling. What do y'all think of the laws regarding bicyclists? I think that if they really wanted people to be more environmentally friendly then they have to be more accommodating of people. Seems very much like they (governing bodies) know that their bread is buttered with money from vehicles while they make nothing off a bicyclist, so screw that guy.",cycling,2024-02-16 07:11:51

1708066411.0,Garmin Varia - I Don’t See The Benefit,"I’m an experienced rider (20+ years all over the world, raced Cat 2/3 for a while). Now in my 40s with family/kids. Somehow managed to get through it all without a major crash of any kind until this past October when a driver ran a stop sign in front of me as I was descending a steep hill at 25mph. Slammed into the car, knocked unconscious, broken ribs, etc. Luckily nothing too serious, but now I’m rethinking safety. I’m already pretty cautious nowadays and largely avoid danger zones. But everyone keeps telling me that I need a Varia and all of the reviews on Reddit talk about it being a “gamechanger”. I just don’t see the benefit, however, and I’m hoping someone can shine some light for me. I’m not opposed to it or knocking it (it seems to do what it is designed to do extremely well), but as GCN Tech put it: “How would it change your behavior?” 

I tend to agree with GCN. If I’m riding on a road with cars, I’m generally always going to be riding as cautiously as possible. If there is room on the berm, I’ll stay on the berm. If there isn’t a berm, I’m still going to be as close to the edge as safely possible. I don’t see how knowing that there is a car or cars behind me is going to change my behavior in any way. 

What WOULD be useful is if it had some kind of advanced “lane departure” early warning or something that tells me that the car is on a collision course for me and that I should dive off the road. But that will never happen.

So what am I missing? OK, so there is a car behind me, so what? Am I going to slow down and pull over for every car? I just don’t get it. It just seems like more noise.",cycling,2024-02-16 06:53:31

I'm not sure why knees hurt, but it also happens when I run. I'm trying to decide how I could spend money to improve this problem while riding. Here's what I've done so far:

\#1 I ride an aluminum gravel bike (Planet X london Road) with 42c tires

\#2 I run my tires at 25 PSI with tubes

This has helped but it's not enough. Here are some more options I've found but haven't tried:

\#1 Bike fit. I have one scheduled for a few days in the future. 

\#2 Replace my aluminum frame with a Carbon/Steel/Titanium frame. I've read all three are better than aluminum but I don't know which is best, or if there are comfort-focused frames for sale. 

\#3 Replace my rigid fork with a suspension fork or replace my whole frame with a full suspension mtb frame. I used to ride a full suspension mtb and it was like a magic carpet, but it was stolen before the first service interval. I ride about 15h/week, and I don't think I could afford to service a full suspension bike every 100-200 hours as most manufacturers call for. 

\#4 Run my tires tubeless. I may also have to replace my wheels-- I'm not sure they're tubeless ready.

I need to replace the bottom bracket to install a newer, power meter compatible crankset to have any options.

How do I determine which replacement BB will fit my frame AND be compatible with a Shimano Hollowtech II road crank?  I accept that it might not be possible, but how do I determine that?

I'm looking to buy a good travel bike, the kind that lets you cycle for 1000 of miles across the country doing wild camping.  
The thing is, while i have a fair amount of experience traveling like that, i'm a total noob about bike themselves.

If you were looking for a travel bike in the 300 to 800$, what would be your criteria ? From what i know :  
\- aluminium is a good choice because it is light and doesnt rust except in real bad conditions  
\- a cassette is mandatory for durability. Any recommendations ?  
\- Are disk brakes really better ?

1707993883.0,Training and Tips for Cycling Holidays,"Hi!  
About a week ago I asked for some advice on renting a bike in Mallorca in April, and I come back with a couple more questions.

At home this winter I'm riding about 100-120km per week, due to lack of time. That's about 3x40km, at 28-29 km/h on average (mostly Z3), and about 1% elevation (1000m per week). I also tend to underfuel, eating about 25g of carbs on 90 minute rides.

In Mallorca I want to make most of the holidays and I'd like to do ride as much as I can doing 80-120km rides (with 600-800m elevation); the idea is to do 70-120-recovery ride-100.

My strategy is:

* To try to go slower, at about 25km/h and thus trying to stay on Z2 as much as posible.
* To stop briefly every hour, and for 10-15min every two.
* To fuel properly, at about 40g/h (I'm 75kg), and about 700mL of water per hour.

I will try to train doing longer rides on weekends during March, but the weather and light-hours are the limiting factor.

Do you have any more suggestions and tips? Thanks!

Overall, it's in great shape for a second-hand purchase. Frame size XS, 26-inch wheels – perfect for my commute plans.

However, here's the hitch – the hydraulic discs are a bit rusty, causing some squeaky noises when braking downhill. Also, unsure about the fluid levels and whether I need brake pad replacements (really likely). Considering the maintenance and the 180 AUD I spent, I'm at a crossroads.

Should I sell it and look for a lower-maintenance option within the same budget? Some interest at the current price, but not sure if I'm underselling a quality bike that might deserve more than 180. Also, some wear on the tires, potential replacements there too.

The worry that maintenance cost will outweigh my budget. It is a great bike, looks nice, but I don't want to make a bad call by putting down money in this project. I am even thinking of fixing it myself, of course not the fluid part, but maybe chain replacement or break pad replacement. Thing is.. i still need the tools for it, again.. money... 

What's your take? Stick with the ATX, invest in fixing it up, or sell and explore other options? Need some advice on whether I got a steal or if it's time to move on. Appreciate your insights! 🚵‍♂️

A few years ago I replaced my flatbar hybrid with a Trek dropbar road bike. Obviously, it took a little bit of getting used to, but it wasn't too hard and I immediately noticed how much faster I could go on the road bike.

A week ago I replaced that old Trek road bike with a new (to me) Giant road bike, again with a drop bar.

I can't quite put my finger on it but the Giant feels harder to ride. It feels like its harder work to turn the wheel. Almost like the wheel is heavy and so takes more energy to get moving, like a fly wheel.

Compared to the old Trek the Giant weighs the same, has the same Shimano Ultegra gears, the seat is the same height, and the pedal cranks the same length. The only possible difference I can see is the frame seems maybe an inch shorter horizontally.

My question is, is it normal to take some time to adjust to a new bike even if it is very similar to your last one?",cycling,2024-02-15 09:24:57

til now i found a lot of reviews of the mechanical Shimano GRX 820 1by 12s from the typical websites and youtuber. All of them are impressed. What i am not able to find are long term experiences and i hope some of you can provide me that. 

Background: My old gravel bike is unfortunately broken and now i am struggling with the decision for the new one. I‘m coming from Sram Rival eTap XPLR AXS and was kind of satisfied. (At the end the brakes are pretty much shit, even LBS couldn‘t do anything against the extrem loud howling).
And now I’m a bit anxious of buying a gravel bike with Rival eTap AxS again. 
On the other hand the Shimano GRX sound promising, but what i loved at the SRAM was, that i dont have to fix or adjust things a lot and it just worked well in terms of shifting.

Does a mechanical GRX need more attention for ex. adjusting due to more moving parts over time? Does anyone uses it day to day?

As I look at this, I think the divots are from my Saris rack. With one bike, the bike sits well to one side. The retaining arm swings up to hold the rear tire in place; a lateral movement. The left side I have the arm extended and push down until it holds the tire.

The difference is one tire the arm is pressed down on the tire, the other the arm is pushed across the tread maybe piling it up. So a 500 mile car trip creats lots of opportunity to wear divots.

My roommate and I would like to stay on good terms with our very kind neighbors who live below us and very close by us. Both also store their cars and things in the garage, and are sensitive to disturbances and noise. I don’t want to draw attention to our garage by storing my bike there. 

I just bought a bike strap to see if it could help me carry the bike up and don the main stairwell, but it’s still a wretched ordeal. 

My sense is that my only other option would be to use a massive Ulock to attach the bike to a pole in our garage, buy a bike alarm, hope no one tries to steal it, and if they do, deal with stressfully piercing alarms at night and potentially very annoyed neighbors.

TL;DR - can’t store my bike inside, too difficult to carry up and on the stairs. Locking to pole in open air garage seems the only plausible option, but I worry about drawing thieves to a shared garage and a loud alarm bothering the neighbors when sometime attempts to steal it. 

Anyone have any other suggestions? Am I too sensitive a neighbor? Am I overestimating Houston’s bike thieves?

UPDATE: Thank you for all the suggestions! Super helpful. I think I'm going to get a folding bike (or another type of easy-to-carry, smaller bike) and try to make it more convenient for me to carry it up and down my stairs. The one I currently own is super cheap, and after receiving confirmation that I am not underestimating Montrose bike thieves, I'd like to keep it in my living space, so will work toward getting a bike that is easy to bring inside.",cycling,2024-02-14 23:05:29

I ride road bike 3-4 times a week during season, doing avg. 70-100km rides and also commute for work using bike (maybe 10km on really good roads every day). I also play tennis 2-3 times a week. 

TLDR had terrible back pain offseason (around end of Dec), went to doc, did an MRI, 3 protrusions - 2mm L3-L4, 5mm L4-L5, 8mm L5-S1. L5-S1 is also sitting on my sciatic nerve, but that's manageable - there is pain, but I can move around, do basic things if I do PT / physio. Context besides that is I'm also super mobile (as in flexible) and that affects how stable I am when doing exercise. 

I'm going to do PT / physio / meds etc. as long as needed, as well as going to start swimming as neurologist and PT said that might help to re-structure my muscles and maybe get my protrusions back in place. 

Obviously no tennis for time being. 

As to cycling I heard mixed opinions - PT says it's ok if I get a bikefit, neurologist says it's dangerous due to bumps / jumps etc. (though I'm only doing road and while yeah roads are not perfect, I don't ride over giant potholes), ortho said that it can help even (if I do bikefit and not aero which is again fine by me).

1707927033.0,Red Light Runners,"Had a scare yesterday. Easy ride, my goal was 25 miles, nice and easy to start my week. I chose a quiet paved multi use trail near my home. There are two traffic lights on this trail dedicated to pedestrians and cyclists to get across major roads in the city. They are known for their danger, as drivers often run these lights. They have been there for years, and yet drivers are still clueless. 40mph speed limit on this road, which means vehicles are at about 50mph. When my light turns green, I always hesitate, make certain all cars are either stopped completely or obviously slowing to a stop.   
Yesterday, my light turns green. Westbound traffic, both lanes, stop as expected. There are no vehicles in the two east bound lanes, EXCEPT for a red sedan about 100 yards down the road. It’s not a factor for me, so I go. I am about halfway into the intersection when the red car blows by behind me. Missed me by maybe half a car length. WOW. My stomach turned. A west bound driver, after I’d safely gotten across apologized for this driver and asked if I was okay. “I’m a cyclist.” He said. Nice guy.  
Anyway, this has gotten into my head. I cut my ride short. Just went home. Rode this morning, on a dedicated bike trail, no vehicles, no crossings. But cut it short. My heart just wasn’t in it. I think this feeling will go away. But does it? Can’t explain the feeling really, just really sobering. And I’m a cautious, very respectful rider. I don’t do stupid stuff.

The June event has three checkpoints and the first leg is pretty flat and fast. After the first checkpoint many groups get broken up and spread out. I think I'd do well to get to the first checkpoint as fast as possible with a group and save some energy. So my question is this. How does someone find a group that suits their needs without overdoing it? I suspect my first step is to not be the guy at the very back of the starting line and get myself in a better position at the start instead of trying to catch up from the back.

1707917904.0,Tightness Pain,"

2 1/2 weeks ago after a run I got a really bad sharp pain on the lateral outside part of hip (right on the bone). Every step I took hurt. At first I was sure it was a case of Bursitis. A week later the pain went down. When I would press on the bone there was no pain. I just felt tightness. I went for acupuncture 3 times and saw an osteopath. 

Since then I have been doing hip strengthening exercises, stopped running, stretching, foam rolling and heating + ice. 

I have just been going to the gym, lifting, jumping rope , rowing. Just doing exercises that don’t cause pain. Because of work by the end of the day I am typically at 15-18,000 total steps…

After 2 weeks, this weekend, I tried a 5 min run, however I felt extremely uncomfortable in my hip and also shooting down to the upper thigh. I tried again yesterday and couldn’t make it far at all both on a treadmill. 

There is no sharp pain, just tightness and an uncomfortable sensation in I would say the TFL area. I am thinking of getting an ultra sound.

I know most of you will say get it diagnosed, I am, however wait time could be up to 6 weeks with my health care plan. Just wanted to see if people have had this happen to them ?

1707914266.0,Right Side of the Lower Back Aches (Since few weeks after cycling),"I'm a 20 year old male who I'd say is generally a fit person. Last month, I went cycling after a while (after about 1 year) with some friends. I cycled about 30k that day and one or 2 days later I had a slight lower back pain on my right side. I initially thought this wasn't due to the cycling and thought it was due to a mistake I did during my squats the day before cycling,  


I had been squatting for a few months and never had an injury since my form is generally good. The day I went cycling, my seat alignment had a small problem so instead of the seat being straight it would slowly point towards the left while I was cycling. This makes me think that my wrong posture was the reason for this lower back pain. I had taken 4 weeks off from the gym and cycling and the pain is slightly there.   


I went cycling yesterday after a month and then when I was cycling, I felt that muscle that had a slight pain was moving when I was cycling. My bicycle seat yesterday was good but only yesterday I was able to realise that my faulty bicycle seat was the culprit. Back when I got injured, I visited a local doctor and he said there is no need for an X-Ray and just gave me anti-inflammation meds and prescribed me some physiotherapy. I visited the physiotherapist but my dumbass left out the cycling incident since I thought the issue was the squats.  


I want to know if anyone has had any similar experience and has recovered since I would like to continue at the gym and not ruin my progress. The fact that the pain is still mildly there makes me wonder if it's something more serious than just a muscle strain and something related to a disc in my lower back.

It's got Campy Xenon 3x9 speed with various issues. The owner had got nice carbon bikes and didn't want to bother fixing it. It had been used for a triathlon once by his wife and then basically abandoned in a corner of their garage. There's a bike wizard in my co-op who can help me in a pinch with the difficult stuff.

What works: 

--the wheels seem good and lightweight, with Miche hubs. The tyres are fine (but 23mm - it can take 25 so I'll probably go with that, I have some lying around)

--the frame, bars, chainrings, cassette and FD seem fine and the frame has a derailleur hanger

What doesn't work:

--the right brifter is toast (the button for switching to harder gears broke off)

--the rear derailleur doesn't work properly

--not sure about the brakes (pads need replacing and the calipers are stiff)

My questions in no particular order:

--would it be worth trying to find Campy parts or should I get rid of them and put some recent Shimano on it? (I've got a bit of wiggle room on the budget as the frame cost next to nothing) 

I was thinking either Sora, older 9-speed 105, or going the whole hog and getting 11-speed.

--Are 9-speed Campy chainrings and cassette compatible with 9-speed Shimano?

--Would switching to Shimano involve getting a new bottom bracket too? (I assume yes)

--Is the freehub compatible with Shimano? (I think I saw a couple of posts saying no to this one)",cycling,2024-02-14 11:49:08
1707910931.0,Slow riding for beginners,"Hi, I am a new cyclist who is struggling to balance on the bike at slow speed. I have been practising for about a week.

I see a lot of advice saying to go faster as it is easier, and I am able to be stable when going quickly (still a bit wobbly sometimes).

However, when I slow down, I am not able to balance at all. For example, when I start the bike from rest, I always swerve around left and right before I pick up speed. When I tried to cycle slow through a tight corridor with many turns, it's impossible (swerve into the wall before I could pick up speed).

As per title, just got me a new bike and I am excited to learn more about it and get some miles in. I’ve been a consistent runner for the last 2 years but injuries have been a problem. So, giving cross training a shot! 

I took the bike out today for a good spin, clocked 27km and 600m of incline and I’ve never felt my quads burn so much! 

Anyway, point of this post was to get some opinions on some questions that popped up during the ride. 

As a runner who is used to running in zone 2, threshold, tempo ect ect… I was wondering how this transitions into cycling. The zone 2 was pretty easy and felt similar if not easier than running. What I found hard was getting into threshold range and staying there. The only way I could really get above 160bpm was on steep inclines but my legs would gas out before my lungs. 

Could I get some advice on how you guys train, what type of workouts you do, where you do them and if you follow a similar 80-20 type balance? What does a typical week of riding look like for you guys? Similar to running eg. Mon easy, tues intervals, wed easy, thurs threshold, Fri easy, sat long? As someone who is fitness oriented, what are some things I should read or know? 

Thats probably too many already so I’ll stop myself! Thanks in advance legends and looking forward to getting more involved. Cheers",cycling,2024-02-14 11:39:47

1707908882.0,Presta 2.0?,"I need to remove a Presta valve core. I have a removal tool like the one seen below.  
[https://www.cyclestore.co.uk/images/products/xtra/73502.jpg](https://www.cyclestore.co.uk/images/products/xtra/73502.jpg)

The Presta valves on my old inner tubes do have a shaved edge where the core meets the main body (The bit the red arrow points at in image below) that the tool fits onto nicely.

[https://postimg.cc/njQdD6Zt](https://postimg.cc/njQdD6Zt)

However the new inner tubes I recently got are circular at that point, therefore you cant get the tool on it.

Are these new inner tube valves different versions with non removable cores or is there a different way to remove the newer ones?

Many thanks for any help.

1707908421.0,NBD,"TL;DR. American bought a UK bike in South Korea and it went great.

I've been wanting a new bike for a while because my Trek fx2 is great for such rides but I'm going 40+ miles and I'm wanting my first road bike. I finally pulled the trigger after realizing I can't get the Trek I want. I live in South Korea and Trek only offers the Domane gen 4 al4 and I couldn't find a US dealer with a gen4 al5 in stock that would ship to an APO address. I had previously played around with Ribble and their bike builder and really liked the customization aspect and built myself a CGR AL Enthusiastic in Carnival Green. Also, using 99spokes.com and comparing the geometries the Domane and CGR are near identical when you compare 54 cm and small respectively. I placed the order on February 5th and was given February 12th as the dispatch date and the bike left on the 10th! If I had worked out the customs process earlier I would have received the bike on the 12th instead of the 14th. I just put it together but it's dark now and I need new light mounts but did go for a quick ride and so far I'm happy with it.",cycling,2024-02-14 11:00:21

I always carry baby wipes to clean the donger area, but for the chamois I'm a bit lost. Is it ok if I spray rubbing alcohol on the chamois and let it dry during night? Is it enough to kill any harmfull bacteria and is it safe for the chamois?

1707901479.0,Training / Commuting - if you were in my postion would you change anything?,"It’s now about 8 months since I started cycling more seriously / making it a part of my lifestyle.   
Originally my commute was 45 miles a week with limited elevation – as my fitness increased, I took longer trips home, weekend rides etc. and then as winter came around, I supplemented with long Z2 rides on the trainer with the odd 4-6 hour here and there.  
I’ve now moved home and my commute is now 105 miles a week with approx. 4,200 ft of elevation, this is approx. 7 and a bit hours of saddle time a week (depending on traffic, weather etc.) now trying to put in a weekend ride as the weather improves / jump back on the trainer for a couple of hours.  
I want to keep increasing my fitness and get faster (only interested in racing myself) – I ride pretty hard on my commute probably the in the ‘hard but not hard enough for optimal training’ and now doing less long Z2 rides than I was before.  
I’m of course not going to stop commuting but if you were me would you try to take these at an easier pace so you had more energy for the weekend / adding in a pure training day or do you think at my beginner level it’s just overthinking it and I’ll make gains even with the not all out maximum efforts for some time yet? Unsure if relevant but I’m 38 and before I started cycling I was a potato.

1707868333.0,Eye protection and night riding - looking for real glass lenses that don't filter UV and aren't polarized!,"The title says it all, but I wanted to add, yes I have used the search bar. I see other people have asked a similar question before but the most popular answers to this question don't really solve my problem.

I am generally a huge proponent of the cheap hardware store eye protection. I have used them on my night rides before, but I've found that even with brand new safety glasses, they still filter some light. I don't want to sound too picky here, but my rides at night tend to be on secluded trails that are very dark. Traveling at speed, even with my lights on full blast still leaves something to be desired. The last time I was out at night, I kept taking my glasses off because I could see more clearly, but then taking the risk of getting a bug in my eye. 

My guess is that real glasses would be better, but every option I find has some kind of UV protection, blue light filter, or is polarized. I feel like this is just going to result in more light being filtered out of my vision. 

I'm blessed to not need corrective lenses so I feel like it should be easy to find this but no luck so far.

I use a road Bell Charger sized for 54-61cm. It fits well, I think, and after adjusting there is little movement and the adjustment strap feels like it's pressing on all sides of my head more or less equally.

I tested Ambush 2 M, Camber L and M.

Ambush 2 M was really narrow, it noticeably pressed on the sides of my head (parietal?) when put on and adjusted and it was hard to put on at all with a hat (a beanie? a toque?) on. The adjustment strap also put most of the pressure on the sides of my head.

Camber L felt much better, but even after tightening to the max I could still rotate it more than the MIPS allows for. Something like 30°, maybe a bit less I think.­ And there was a noticeable gap between the strap on the back of my head and the actual rear of the helmet.

Camber M was better than Ambush at least, but it still feels narrow and I do notice it's tighter on the sides. It would be probably uncomfortable with a hat under it.

1707843743.0,"Compression Ring (for Integrated Cabling) for 1.25"" Steerer Tube?","I've been terribly stubborn in my mission to achieve semi-integrated cabling on my Canyon Endurace, which has a 1.25"" steerer tube. My fork doesn't support internal cabling, so I'm happy to leave the front brake cable external.

I've seen a few headset products (Acros, Deda, Token, etc) that help achieve semi-integrated cabling conversions, enabled by spacers that collect the cables from underneath the stem, and down into a special compression ring placed inside the upper headset bearing, which allows cables to pass into the head tube and run beside the steerer tube. These compression rings, however, all fit only 1.125"" steerer tubes.

I'm determined to find such a kit / compression ring that would allow me to do the same thing with my 1.25"" steerer tube. Perhaps a new upper headset bearing would be needed/included. Does anyone know of such a product, or perhaps someone can put me in my place because no such product exists?

1707842074.0,First big alpine adventure,"The other day i got this idea stuck in my head that I want to ride my first alpine road bike adventure in 2025. The idea of crossing the alps with my bike just fascinates me. Being from Germany it makes sense to start somewhere fairly accessible by train. The routes I have checked out on komoot so far are:  
  
Munich-Lago di Garda via the infamous Stelvio  
  
Munich - Venice via the Großglockner Hochalpenstraße  
  
Basel -Locarno via Zurich, either Klausenpass or Oberalppass, and the old Gotthardpass (Cobblestones will likely be brutal but the scenery is nice and the cobbles just add character)  
  
while I have ridden climbs before, I have yet to tackle anything remotely as big as those passes. My alpine experience is basically 0, that is why I want to tackle it in 2025 so I can build up some stamina this year.  
  
Do you have any other suggestions? Or any other routes that I should consider? I would love to also ride the french alps but getting there is not that easy and I dont speak french. The trip should be about 3-5 days and include at least one ""epic climb""",cycling,2024-02-13 16:34:34

1707840908.0,Make Stan’s race sealant from regular,"So I just opened my first bottle of Stan’s Race sealant and instantly recognized the “crystals” inside as regular old perlite.  Perlite is sold for a variety of uses from the white things in your potting soil (aerates and holds water) to insulation (my house is insulated with the stuff - not vermiculite which was the mineral with asbestos) to making lightweight concrete.  

So you can make your own “better” sealant by adding some perlite to any sealant.  It is easy to crush up in your fingers or screen through a piece of house window screen if you want to pick the size of particles that you use.  I think I might filter this bottle of race sealant through some window screen to be able to inject it into valves.

It turns out the cables were worn, and the front derailleur was too high. I'm glad they were experienced and skillful.

 Previously I had it sent to the bike shop where I purchased the bike,  where they replaced the cable but didn't tune the derailleur correctly. I'm glad that Bikebros was able to do a better job.

Now I'm continuing to use my 7yr bike and looking to get it resprayed in a year or so.

Original:

Hi guys need some advice on upgrading my road bike in the most cost effective way.

Context:

I bought my first road bike 7 years ago, it was a btwin triban 520 for 800SGD. It's an aluminum bike with carbon fork and SHIMANO SORA groupset with triple chainring. It still works fine but bike maintenance guys have been having issues reliably tuning to accommodate for the biggest chain ring. Now a days I'll need to force it into the big chain ring by pulling extremely hard on the lever. And the tooth on chain ring and cassette are worn.

Needs: 

I don't want to get a flashy new bike, as I'll be more paranoid if it'll be stolen. But may do so if it's cost effective.

I feel that using my old bike with an upgraded groupset can deter thieves as it's not as attractive to be taken.

This bike is used for market runs, running errands and to get to school and back (9km both ways).

I am not looking to spend more than 1.5k SGD on a new bike, and preferably not more than 600 SGD on a groupset + installation.


Options: 

1) Buy a new bike 

2) Replace the Shimano Sora groupset (SGD $450) before installation. But double chain ring.

3) Upgrade to Shimano 105 groupset (SGD 600) before installation",cycling,2024-02-13 14:37:50
1707834415.0,Deciding on the Ideal Bicycle: The Challenge of Matching Daily Commutes with Epic Tours Using Rose Bikes,"My upcoming bicycle purchase will be from Rose. Currently, I'm evaluating the Reveal 04 Ultegra (Endurance) against the Backroad (gravel) model. At present, I ride a basic Gravel bike by Triban, which I quite enjoy. However, after taking the Rose Reveal Ultegra for a test drive, I was amazed by its noticeably easier handling. I really loved it!

As for my cycling habits, I typically embark on shorter rides ranging from 50 to 200 kilometers in a day, and once a year, I undertake a longer journey spanning 800 to 1000 kilometers. The majority of these tours are on paved roads, with about 10-15% comprising light gravel surfaces, such as forest trails.

In warmer months, I plan to use it for commuting. During the winter, I switch to using my e-bike.

I intend to equip the Reveal with the GP 5000 tires and consider switching to the 4 Seasons for longer trips. However, I'm currently undecided, as I'm also contemplating whether a gravel option might be better due to its greater tire clearance.

&#x200B;

In November last year a car decided to turn left without indication onto a side road. This took me out sending me over the bonnet and into the road, damaged my bike, and luckily only soft tissue damage.

I do not have video evidence and the only evidence I have is from pictures the cyclist behind me took as soon as the accident happened, and the cyclist as an eye witness

I have a solicitor handling this for me and I filled a report with the police. The drivers insurance company have come back and said it was my fault and I cycled into the car. The police have come back to me and said that the driver is at fault. With this provided to the insurance company they have responded and said that I am still at fault as the driver was not turning left but driving straight ahead, that the witnesses at the scene are friends of mine, and that they are still waiting for the police report!

https://www.cannondale.com/en-eu/gear/components/seatposts/road-seatposts/save-carbon-road-seatpost-254

Backstory: I mounted the saddle, torqued to spec and rails began developing fine hairline cracks after a number of rides. The crack appeared further away from where the rail was clamped. I’m a 6’5” 95kg rider.

I warrantied the seat with one authorised dealer and they got the new saddle back from Specialised. I brought my bike in and they refused to give me the saddle saying it shouldn’t be on that seatpost and that they would lose money if they gave me the warrantied saddle. They said they advised Specialised of this effectively trying to kill my warranty claim. A big argument ensued, I threatened to sue them because I wrote to Cannondale and they wrote in black and white that the seatpost will support oval carbon rails. This dealer didn’t care.

I went to another authorised dealer and processed the same warranty claim. Specialised warrantied the saddle for me again and I received it no problems.

To me that is acknowledgment that the fault was with the saddle and the rail layup/production. I am however worried about mounting it again and it cracking. Cannondale has this seatpost for their Fabric carbon rail offerings and they confirmed it supports oval carbon rails. Thoughts are appreciated.",cycling,2024-02-13 11:24:41

Currently I am in market for a bike and would love to have more expert opinion on making a correct choice.

Although I've been riding bicycle since I was a little kid, but I have a very little knowledge on enthusiast level bike.  Nicest Bike I've ever owned was a used-Giant Escape 3, which I unfortunately had to sell when I was moving across the country last  year =(

After rummaging through information I can find online(mostly Youtube) & consulting with an expert at REI's bike store, I have narrowed down to a few choices, but would love to have more guidance or feedback.

To provide more context on my needs/goals:

---------------------

Primary Use: 

1. Ride bicycle around the designated Bike roads. (Including the bike road on beaches @ Santa Monica and various other parks throughout SoCal)

2. Daily exercise by either riding around local parks or riding on trainer in my garage.

3. Non-paved Bike Trails (Not necessarily looking to ride rugged trails with stiff climb, but open to riding on dirt road trails that are relatively flat. Chino Hill maybe?)

---------------------

2 Bikes I am looking at right now.

1. REI Co-op Cycles CTY 2.1 Bike - $799  (or CTY 1.1 for $499?)

2. Used Trek Domane 2/ road bike (2021 model) - $499    (From Youtube reviews and Trek page, they do say this bike is a good all-rounder with a good versatility for every use + it is more geared toward comfort / longer ride, rather than speed/sprint, which fits what I am looking for)

---------------------

Questions:

1. Would it be a good idea to purchase a drop-bar bike without much experience in it?

2. Are thoso reviews and description on Domane accurate? 

3. Do you think it is necessary to go with CTY 2.1 for the ""bouncy"" front wheels?

4. If I do go for the used bike, what are some of the things that I should check?  When I was buying my old Giant Escape 3, I purchased it from the local bike store and they took good care of me....but this time I am purchasing from an individual seller. 


Thank you very much in advance, and looking to hear from y'all!",cycling,2024-02-13 03:57:46

1707788483.0,Wattage on gym bikes vs actual road bikes,"I've noticed this rather weird discrepancy between the wattage that I see of average cyclists and of my gym's bike (it's decently old keiser m3, I think).

I'm a mountain biker so the whole concept of wattage and ftp is rather foreign to me but since it's cold outside, I bike at my uni's varsity gym and track the wattage.

I realized I have never seen anyone average anything higher than 120-130, even though the whole gym is intended for the varsity athletes. Most are pushing an average of about 70 watts, and I push about 105-110 watts.

I met an actual road biker there once who biked on it before me, and his average was 95 watts during a rather decently intensive 40-minute workout.

I can push 250-300 watts on that bike, but I can sustain it for about 30 seconds at most.

I know that average cyclists push about 250-300 watts and almost 0% that average 100 or below.

I don't own a road bike to test, so I was wondering if anyone knows anything about these things.

Ps. It's the only bike in the gym with a meter on it, and I weigh 130 lbs while the other guy looked like around 160 lbs (with visibly more muscle mass on his legs than me).",cycling,2024-02-13 01:41:23

I also want to cut some weights, so I count calories and try to eat less. I found that 2 rest days seemed not to be able to help me recover well. So I thought it might be the lack of calories. And then I packed myself with a little more carbs, which leaded to bad sleep.

In short, I guess the volume of training and the intake of calories do not match, so I eat a little more carbs. However, it turns out that more carbs affect my digestion and give me bad sleep.

1707783887.0,Get another bike fit? (US),"Hey all, end of 2022 I was stupid and bought myself a Tarmac SL6 having not ridden a bike in years. I'm not super fit and it's been a struggle to make it work for me. I struggle with making the reach and saddle feel right (I constantly feel like I am ""falling into"" the bars), slight back pain, but mostly numb hands and numb feet. Just never felt right. The bike is definitely appropriately sized for my body (6'4"", 35.5 inch inseam, 190 lb, 61cm frame)

I got an expensive fit done and it did not help at all. The fitter was so bad that the he didn't tighten the headset on my bike so steering was dangerous. I've tried following up with him but he kinda shoves me off and refuses to directly address that the fit doesn't work. I even emphasized I'm ok with him being honest if this frame just does not work for me, but he insisted I'd be fine. After weeks of trying the new fit with some core exercises in between, I felt no improvement.

I found a place near me that does fits at $250, much less than I paid previously, and considering trying again. I also had thought of buying a trainer so I can ride inside during the winter and trying an AI bike fit instead. I don't have the money to do both. Wondering what may be likely to help more?

Haven't done many miles because of these issues. I always wonder if it's just a matter of powering through, but I have no idea anymore.

Would be a great bonus to be able to ride indoors before end of March.

Last note, I know everyone is going to say sell it and buy an endurance bike, but this bike was really expensive and I took a fall trying to learn clipless on it. It's kinda dinged up and, on top of the already dismal blue book value, I'd take a giant loss selling it, if I could sell it at all.

1707777903.0,"Tour riding 50-66km per day, for 6 consecutive days, no rest days.

1707777425.0,"For a road bike that's meant to go fast, how do you all feel about rim brakes vs. disc brakes?","Am looking at used carbon road bikes on craigslist, my budget is around $1k. A lot of the bikes have rim brakes. I personally don't have a problem with rim brakes, because I like the simplicity of them, and how they are easy to adjust.

I find disc brakes kind of intimidating, because they seem more ""complicated"" to me (I am not the most mechanically inclined person), and a friend has disc brakes that screech really loud, and he hasn't been able to fix it.

But... I have heard that disc brakes have more braking power, are better in wet conditions, and won't eat up your wheels over time. (On mountain bikes, disc brakes are also better, I hear, because you avoid grit getting into your rim brakes and tearing up the wheel)

I guess in my dream world, with an unlimited budget, I'd go for all the ""bells and whistles"" like electronic shifting, disc brakes, etc. But since I am on a budget, I wonder if sticking with rim brakes is an OK decision if I'll rarely be riding in the rain. I'm not super hardcore; my fastest descents so far have been like in the 30s mph. I believe the fastest I have hit is 38 mph.

also: just throwing this out there, if you had about 1k USD to spend, and wanted a fast and reliable road bike, what would you look for?

1707772615.0,Anything special that needs to be done when using Gatorskin tires?,"Hello all, I just got back from a 10 mile walk.

Story: I recently changed tires to some Gatorskin tires. Installation was a bit annoying but managed to make the swap. I, however, made the mistake of re-using a tube that was patched. I said to self, ""no biggie, once that blows Ill just swap it for new tube"". The tube did last for two days worth of riding(about 80miles) but yesterday afternoon when I got back from superbowl gathering it was flat(front). I tried to pump air and could hear the leak clearly. Immediately i knew it was the patched tube. Again, I said to self, ""no biggie, ill just replace for new tube like I planned and thank goodness it didnt go flat on the road"". Again, replacing tube on a wheel with Gatorskin tires is a PIA!!! 

Today, I go for ride and on way back the front goes flat. WTF!! I do due diligence, and inspect tire for any holes, stuck debris, anything, etc. and nothing. I try pumping air and I could hear a leak but cant really pinpoint where. At this point, I decide I am just going to do the walk(before haters start hating, to be clear, I CHOSE TO WALK) instead of trying to replace the tube. I have a bad back and my knee was acting up since a few days ago. Yes, I could have called uber. No, I could not have called someone since I dont have anyone. So, in this situation, for me, it was better to walk, but for others of course it may be better to try and replace the tube or call someone.    

When I did the first and second installs of the tube, I also did my due diligence and inspected the wheel for any particles, debris, etc. that could cause the new tube or any tube to be punctured from inside of the tire. 

My questions: Do Gatorskin tires need any special ""anything"" when installing new? Do they need special tubes to be paired with? I havent done any other inspections since I got back from the walk but what else should I be looking for(like I said, the wheel should be clean)?. Or is this dilemma just comes down to bad luck and bad/faulty new tube and I should not overthink it?",cycling,2024-02-12 21:16:55

1689107267.0,I sent a driver to jail,"This happened Friday. 

I was riding on a short connector street that happens to divide two parking lots for a hotel with a riverside bar. The kind of place that has old guys listening to bad cover bands on a patio while drinking overpriced IPAs and highballs. 

A large Silver Jeep pulled out of the lot to my right, without noticing I was there. I was only going around 15mph so even though I had to brake hard I was fine. His window was down so I could see he didn’t bother to look either direction and cut all the way across both lanes even though he was turning right. So a big swerving turn in his big ugly Jeep. 

I yelled out, “ Hey hey hey! You didn’t even look! If I was on a motorcycle you could have killed me. “

The guy responded by telling me to eff off and to get a life along with some other nonsense as he drove off. 

Ok whatever. I followed him to the next light and not really wanting a further issue, I stayed behind him until he signaled and started a right turn onto a busier blvd. I scooted up to the light but instead of turning he slammed on his brakes and screamed “I’ll f@cking run over you!” 

I countered by saying, “You better not be drinking.”  

He yelled some more and the light changed so someone blew their horn at him and he gunned  away. I crossed the intersection, pulled over and said “hey Siri, call the _____ Police.” I hadn’t gotten his full tag but saw the first two letters and that it was in state. 

I was still on the phone with dispatch when I see a patrol car going the same direction as the jerk. Dispatch confirmed that they were looking so I rang off. 

I rode for a couple of hours and as I got back into the city I saw a bike cop. I’d called in one other confrontation this summer so I stopped and basically asked “Am I that guy that annoys them with these calls?” 

He said no, that in fact they’d have to research my name on purpose to see any calls I put in and that I should definitely call in especially when I was verbally threatened. 

He then asked, was it you that called in the Jeep? I affirmed and he smiled and said “They took that guy downtown.” 

When my GF got in from work a few hours later, I told her about it. She looked it up and sure enough there was an arrest for his second DUI with him booked about 40m after I called. 

Keep your wits about you and your phone handy.


EDIT. I’m not a hero. And I’m not a bootlicker cop lover. 

But thank the system, the cops did their jobs and all I did was make a phone call. I didn’t face down a gun or lay my life on the line. 

I’m fact no one did. They just did what they were paid to do and took a threat off the street.

1627072591.0,I shared my love of cycling with my brother and it got him killed,"He'd been cycling for 3 months after I gave him my old bike I wasn't using, He went out for a ride two weeks ago today, nobody saw him leave, I knew he was out on a ride because I saw his bike was gone, hour or so later someone rings the doorbell and it's a police officer asking for him, he'd had a head on collision with a car on a country lane he rode on all the time about a mile from home, he was wearing a helmet but it wasn't enough, he badly fractured his scull, bruised his brain, broke nearly every bone in his face and more.

He had two emergency surgeries and spent 10 days on the ICU, there was a period where it appeared he would recover with an unknown amount of disability, but unfortunately he deteriorated and was declared brain dead.

Irrationally I feel as if I've been betrayed by a close friend, how could cycling let this happen to my brother? I knew cycling had its dangers and that people even died, that drivers will overtake too close on busy roads, but the kind of catastrophic injuries my brother received on a quiet road he knew well truly shocked me, I feel a deep guilt for being the one who introduced him to the sport, even though everyone tells me not to, I don't think I'll ever be able to cycle again.
How could I let my family worry about me everytime I go for a ride having seen the aftermath first hand? How could I clear my mind and lose myself in cycling like I used to after this?

I'm not writing this in an attempt to put anyone else off cycling, nobody knows the pure joy cycling can bring a person better than me, if you'd of asked me two weeks ago if there was anything that would make me stop cycling I would probably have told you no, I would have lived on my bike if I could, cycling was my stress relief and my passion, if I wasn't riding I was planning a ride or watching videos on cycle maintenance, I loved cycling, a lot, every part of it, but I loved my brother more, I still do. 

I will ask a couple things of anyone patient enough to read this far, Love the people you have while you have them, spend quality time with them while you can, you might not get as much time as you hoped or expected, and wear your helmet, although it didn't save my brother like I wish it had, his helmet gave him a chance, a shot at life, without it he'd have died on impact.

Especially with ""lock down"" over the last few months, cycling for even an hour a day and feeling that has lifted my mood so much.

I can't compare running or anything else to it, there's an aspect of freedom that comes with cycling I don't find with anything else. Sweating up the hills and coasting down them, as Hemingway put more eloquently than I ever could, is good for the soul, not to mention the exercise becomes a side effect of having fun.

*It is by riding a bicycle that you learn the contours of a country best, since you have to sweat up the hills and can coast down them.... Thus you remember them as they actually are, while in a motorcar only a high hill impresses you, and you have no such accurate remembrance of country you have driven through as you gain by riding a bicycle.*",cycling,2020-06-01 20:29:21
1602543414.0,First time assaulted on the bike and convenient cop,"Never had anything close to this happen before. I’m in the bike lane on a 3 lane wide street and guy creeps out of a driveway trying to make a right. As I’m about to pass his car jolts forward and I have to swerve out of the bike lane, luckily no car to my left, to avoid him. I made eye contact and mouthed “what the fuck” as I rode by him.

Then I hear the squealing tires and engine reving  behind me, he pulls up next to me and starts to get super close. Starts cussing and yelling at me and chucks a water bottle & a big cup of soda at me. Water bottle hits me but soda never cleared his door and gets all over his passenger seat which seems to piss him off more. He’s pretty much pinned me against another car and the only thing I can do is unclip and back up which I do and he gets out of his car. I’m fully prepared to throw hands and then I remembered... I have pepper spray for this exact situation!

I bust it out, ready to blind this asshat and I hear a siren and see red and blue lights... police were heading in the other direction and saw the whole thing. The only time I ever needed a cop to be there and they were. For the record, I would have 100% gotten my ass beat, dude had a good 75 lbs on me and I was in full kit.

He tried to say I was the aggressor and I had sprayed into his car but I hadn’t dispensed the pepper spray yet and the cop saw the majority of it. I def chose to press charges.",cycling,2020-10-12 22:56:54
1622477179.0,My son just cost me $200 and I couldn’t be more proud.,"My son is 8 and he recently started getting bored riding around our driveway, so I took him to a local state park with miles of trails. He loved it, and we go regularly now. We stick to the easier trails, but even so, some of the hills are pretty tough. On one hill he just couldn’t make it, so I thought it would be fun to set it as a challenge. I told him if he could make it without stopping I’d get him the Nintendo Switch Lite he was interested in.  The next few rides, he made progress, but was still making it  less than half the way up before stopping. Today he decided he would get it and attacked the hill six times in a row before he finally made it. I am one proud dad. Now he wants to do more challenges.",cycling,2021-05-31 16:06:19
1595723838.0,Day 8 Adventure,"I'm 74 years old, and just setting up a morning cycling regimen. This is Day 8. Headed out at 6am.

Rode 20.4 km (12.7 mi) this morning, a new record. Yay.

Happened across a woman, probably mid 30s, sitting on a bench facing  the river, practicing harmonica. I could tell she was a beginner.  Stopped and listened a minute. Engaged her in conversation. We talked  harmonicas. She asked how long I'd been playing, so I figured it out. 48  years. Turned out this was her *very first* morning, with her *brand new* echo harmonica! We had a nice chat.

I also saw a men's softball  team practicing in their uniforms. I  stopped and watched for a while. They were good. Saw some good plays.

Also saw a group of about 10 ninjas all in black, doing some very intense exercises like duck walk with staff. I didn't know ninja clubs existed, but I guess they do.

On the bike path I saw several bike clubs on *fast* bikes. My bike's not bad, maybe US$300. They have $3000 bikes, and strong bodies; they go like the wind.

Oh yeah. I also saw God, when I stopped briefly at a Daoist temple by  the river. I didn't have my glasses, so God was pretty fuzzy. Nice  dragon columns though; they were closer.

But the happiest thing was the conversation with the harmonica player. Great fun.

i absolutely love it. i go for 8-10 mile rides every morning to start my day (hoping to increase that distance over time), and i’ve never felt this awake in my day-to-day life. it’s gotten to a point where all i look forward to throughout the day is my next bike ride. i’ve also consumed hours of cycling content (shoutout to GCN on Youtube)—heck, i’ve even started watching the Tour de France. 

i just love the little rituals that come with owning a bike. checking your tires before a ride, turning your lights on, washing it, lubing it—everything. it sounds stupid, but i feel like my daily routine feels a lot more structured due to this bike. i’ve never felt such consistency in a workout routine before. 

i try not to rest my happiness on material things, but i’ve never been happier and it’s all because of my beautiful bicycle. i know this is a bit of a ramble but i had to let this out somewhere.

1646930012.0,Cycling cured my incurable health condition,"Hey all. Wanted to share my story about cycling. I’ve enjoyed riding bikes all my life, got a used road bike 7 years ago in college, and just last year got into seriously riding it. 

Three years ago I developed a health condition called small nerve fiber neuropathy. It affects everyone different, but for me it caused a burning sensations across 90% of my body. Easiest way you can relate to it is having a sunburn everywhere all the time. It’s unknown how it started, and for that reason can’t be cured. My doctors told me the best thing I can do for myself is to exercise and get blood flowing to my damaged nerves. 

Last summer I moved to a bike friendly town and started riding about 6 hours a week. Now I’m up to about 8 hours. Last fall I started to notice a decrease in pain, and by winter I started to not feel any pain in some places, while the rest of the places I did feel pain the level of pain was significantly lower. We ran tests to look at my nerves and saw that my nerves have healed/are healing.

My neurologists are attributing this to the road biking I’ve been doing. It hurt to ride at first, but because of riding I am no longer suffering every second of every day. Not sure if this is the place for it, but I wanted to share how cycling changed my life.",cycling,2022-03-10 16:33:32

I rode a few miles and ended my route with a flat straight to get back home, limit is 25mph but I don't have computers so I just ride free with no care in the world. I give it one last good push before the ride is over and fly, right when I hit the corners there's a cop car that passes me and I'm thinking nothing of it. Flips his lights on and I thought... is he pulling me over?

So I slow down and stop and he stops and gets out and starts walking my way. I'm thinking, what did I do? He starts with the hey how you doings, and asks if I knew why he stopped me. ""I have no clue."" This is when he hits me with, ""Got you going 30 in a 25, I was behind you for the whole straight.""

No fucking way... Seriously?

He laughed and said, ""I didn't even know there were cyclists around here!"" (I live in a little poor town, the cyclist population is one, me.) He got into how he just bought a bike to ride for some fun and asked if he could tag along some time, so the population is now two. Told me stay safe and have a good ride, and we parted ways.

1661902589.0,My worst bonk: Ditch Pepsi.,"I thought you all might appreciate this story from a few years back…

So I borrowed a demo bike from the shop I was working at. Decided to take it out for a super quick ride one morning. I was planning on maybe 5 miles. Didn’t eat anything or bring any water… just my bibs and jersey.

The bike was so fun I ended up just keeping on going. It was right when the new Specialized Roubaix came out with the Future shock. And it was my first time riding Di2.  At the time I lived at the top of a mountain, and the descents were sooo fun. That bike descended so well, as I wasn’t getting chattered much from the shitty road surface.  So I ended up about 15-20 miles from home…. And it was all uphill back.

So I started pedaling back and with like 10 miles to go I was absolutely spent. This was right before the 2016 election in rural NY state. There were trump flags all over and Obama sucks spray painted on the roads. No joke. So I wasn’t feeling so comfortable stopping at someone’s house to ask for water in my Peter Pan suit.

Bonking so hard I couldn’t see straight. I’m literally thinking about eating pine cones and grass. Seriously, I’m never thought about that before and I was considering how bad it would be. Or asking someone for some water and a slice of bread. Anything. I was just spinning In my lowest gear. Super Dizzy. I pull over to the side of the road at the bottom of the last climb to my house. It’s hot. And I’m just laying in a ditch. No one stops… 

In the ditch I see a sun bleached bottle of Pepsi… Probably a 1/3rd of a bottle left.

I crawl over to it. Unscrew the top. Totally flat. It’s probably been here for months. But it doesn’t smell like piss or dip spit or anything…

So I chug that fucker. Warm flat ditch Pepsi!

I literally have never felt the effects of sugar so quickly before! I almost instantly felt better. Like I had my special meter return to full. I could feel the energy returning to me. It was wild. I’ve never since felt that sort of replenishment. It was amazing. 

I hopped out of the ditch. And pedaled the climb back home. And honestly I didn’t do to bad on the way back.I felt great!

I probably have herpes from the ditch Pepsi. But it saved me. And now I know to always eat and bring at least a gel with me for any sort of rides I do.

Thanks ditch Pepsi!",cycling,2022-08-30 23:36:29

I copied this content directly from a facebook post in a triathlon group I'm in. The OP gave me permission to post here. We were hoping to identify this driver and pass along a whole lot of gratitude from a lot of people. Please let me know if this is not an appropriate post:

 

""Dear Mitsubishi SUV Driver,

You were behind the wheel of a blue Mitsubishi Outlander in the vicinity of Lisbon, OH at approximately 7:30pm tonight. I was riding my triathlon bike westbound on Rt. 154 with my friends Kevin and Mike. We were 28 miles into a difficult 43 mile ride when the heavens opened up. By the time we got to Elkton, it was raining so hard we could barely see. We were soaked to the bone and riding hard to quickly reach safe shelter. We were 4 miles from our destination when you passed us by. You gave us plenty of room, going slowly into the opposite lane, so as not to send up a rooster tail of water from the rapidly deepening puddles. A quarter mile further on, I saw you sitting in a roadside park and ride. I briefly wondered if you had stopped because the conditions were too poor to continue. But I soon realized your intentions. As our pathetic little peloton sped by you, you pulled out on the road a respectful distance behind us; turned on your 4-way flashers; and followed us the final miles into town. You had our six.

As we arrived safely at our vehicles, you once more passed us by. You didn't roll down your window to lecture us about foolish behavior. You didn't give us a stern look or a knowing wag of the finger. You didn't even pause in a self-congratulatory manner for the heaps of gratitude that surely would have been bestowed upon you. No, you simply gave a nod of your head, a honk of your horn, and continued on about your business. You sir, are my hero and the guardian angel of cyclists everywhere. Your simple act of kindness was the single most courteous gesture I have ever been a party to on the road. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Signed,

A Grateful Cyclist

1590394194.0,Is my cycling 'career' over?,"I was riding my daily ride and near the end I had to do full stop since there was a stop sign. No big deal I thought and started to brake and releasing my left leg. I was unable to release it so I went to my right foot and to my surprise couldn't release that either. At this moment my speed was near to 0 and the crossing road had some traffic so I couldn't have kept going. I stopped my bike and took a fall on my right side. I only got tiny hole in my leg sleeve otherwise I'm fine.

Now I am wondering am I done? I mean good 3 to 5 people saw me falling and even one car stopped and asked if I was okay. Any thoughts?",cycling,2020-05-25 08:09:54
1624045449.0,Today as a 27 year old man I finally learned how to ride a bike,"Me and my girlfriend have taken a job teaching English in Thailand and were told that cycling/motorbike were the best ways of getting around as the school is pretty far from the centre of town. Cue my anxiety as my girlfriend turns to me and says ""yeah you're gonna have to learn"".

So after around 20 years of avoiding it, we finally rented a Boris bike and she taught me how to ride in a gravelly, bumpy back alley to save my dignity. Within an hour I was pedalling up and down the alley, amazed that I was staying upright as I was hitting nasty bumps.

Feels good man, can't believe what I've missed out on all these years!

Edit: if there's anyone reading this looking for reassurance in learning to ride as an adult, trust me, if I can do it, anyone can. Trust yourself, pedalling makes you stable!",cycling,2021-06-18 19:44:09
1596742112.0,My new crew rides like crazy and every single one is retired.,"Been cycling by myself for awhile and went to meet a friend for an early ride, she overslept and I decided to head out alone. Get to the trail head waiting for the crosswalk to change, when three older men ride up beside me and start up a nice chat. This chat lasted for 14 miles. And then became a light breakfast. And then some more chatting for another 12 miles. 

Lead man is teaching me about the bikes, the trails, etiquette the entire time without making me feel stupid or ""new"", the rest are just happy to have a new face that can keep pace and tell bad jokes. We get to our end point and we exchange phone numbers for future rides, I expect nothing to come of it. Same night I get a text telling me to meet for the next mornings ride. 
I have to open my store in the morning and gotta drop halfway thru the ride. I let everyone know I made it home and get a photo of everyone smiling and thumbs up. 

These guys are amazing, supportive and nothing like I've experienced in the cycling community. I am still having trouble riding distance alone and it's not physical. It's mental. These guys are all love and are assisting me with my overall confidence. (I've tried to find people and never quite meshed with individual end goals) Lead man texts me on days we don't ride together to see if I went on a ride, tells me to keep on going. They plan coffee rides and show me new trails, planning for a big fat ride before winter kicks in. 

I hope everyone can find a group like this and I'm glad my friend overslept.

Sorry my sentence structure is awful. Lol",cycling,2020-08-06 19:28:32
1641142944.0,Cycling saved my life,"Last year this time, I was really fat, almost bordering on obesity. Was starting a new job. I felt really bad about myself and had very low self confidence. I started walking to lose weight but got very bored.

And then I saw my neighbor had an extra cycle and I thought why not try that, it maybe fun. And I started cycling.

I used to get tired after cycling 3-4 km. At 6km I used to start panting. But it was fun. And liberating. The most alive I felt. So I Continued. And slowly slowly I increased the number of kms. I remember when I first completed 30kms at a stretch, I stopped my cycle and took a deep breath. It felt so surreal.

And then I kept on building myself. I completed 2300+kms this year and 2, 100+ km trips. Last year me could never fathom me doing something remotely close to this. I know these aren't like really great numbers, but they feel so good. I hope to achieve more this year. 

I cannot express in words how it would feel. Everyday, however bad a day I had, I had something to look forward to at night. This was something I had and no one could take from me. It helped me lose weight. It helped me feel good and get some confidence. It helped me so much.

The last ride of 2021, I was so emotional. I actually cried. It felt so so surreal. Cycling might have actually saved my life. I will always be grateful for this.

Edit : all this was also possible only because one friend of mine pushed me. He was the one who kept motivating me to do better each time.",cycling,2022-01-02 17:02:24
1614449281.0,Cars that yield to cyclists unnecessarily - please don't - you're going to cause an accident,"Probably preaching to the converted in this sub, but this happens often enough as drivers think they are doing good when they are not.

Just this morning I was waiting to make a left turn from a side road at a T-intersection when a car approaching from the right (far side of the main road) slowed down and stopped. At first I thought they were waiting to make a turn without using blinkers so I turned to watch traffic coming in the other direction - there was some traffic so I waited... and waited... then I started wondering if they had stopped for me.

Long story short - they eventually gave it full gas and stormed off down the road, clearly upset.

There are many other variations of this theme and they're almost all bad as they create confusion in everyone else in the situation - especially other drivers that aren't in on the game. I don't want to have to second guess whether a driver is trying a misguided act of courtesy, or they are just lost. The driver hesitating at the stop sign - are they waiting for me or are they just playing with their phone and about to git the gas pedal when the car behind honks?

Follow the rules and this confusion goes away.

Edit: I had no idea the scale of this problem - thanks for the comments. For the doubters, I suggest [this article in Bike Portland](https://bikeportland.org/2014/09/17/get-legal-nice-dangerous-make-fault-collision-109655). Intro:

>When road users go out of their way to accommodate others when there is no legal authority for doing so, it creates real trouble later if someone gets hurt as a result of their “nice” gesture. In this column, I’ll go over some common scenarios where being what you think is good can actually be very bad.

I googled around and found cases where these ""niceholes"" end up in court. As a cyclist I'd rather not get hurt (or worse) as a result of a kind but illegal gesture.",cycling,2021-02-27 18:08:01

About half way through I was joined by two ridders on Ebikes who mocked me for ""struggling"" and then stopped at the top and waited for me and continued to laugh at me and told me to get a real bike (I ride a specialized allez)

1691466597.0,I bonked in the stupidest place...,"So, I had a 100km ride planned. It was a nearly perfect day for it. Mostly shaded, except for the final couple miles. (This will be important.)

So, I pack my standard 100km level of food, and I know I have a couple water stops where I can refill water.

Anyways, start rolling. My house is on a bit of a hill (this will also be important later, too), and so I get a nice downhill to start, and then a small climb and on to the main flat part of my ride.

I make it to my first food and water break, and then onto the second. This is where things go sides. My normal filling station is not there. (It's a gatorade jug thing that someone fills for cyclists.) Bummer. Go a bit further, without water, to find a spigot at a house that is accessible. Fill my water and drink from the spigot. But it's got a ton of iron in it. No big deal. Actually probably drink more water than I normally would since I have unlimited water, basically.

Then I go back to my pack, and realize I *didn't* pack my second bar. Oh, crud. I have half the food I thought I did. That's not great.

Well, now I'm further than I thought I was going to go, and I'm out of food.

Well, I'm okay. I'm only 20 miles or so from home. No big deal, really. I know that I can cut a couple miles off to make the distance a bit less.

So, start heading home, and head to the short cut. And, because this is how my day is working, it starts raining, and then hailing. F-ing massive hail, and the water is splashing up on me. I was not prepared for this, either. It was beautiful all day, and then we get a freak hail and rain storm, and I'm not on my regular route.

At this point, I should have just gone into a bar, and called my wife to pick me up.

But no, I plug on. Cold, miserable, without enough food, but at least well hydrated with extra iron.

Now, I'm 4 miles from home. And I'm at sea level, with no shade, riding towards the sun, in downtown. It's a bit more stressful than I really wanted to do, but it does cut off those extra miles.

So, now I'm 1 mile from home. I'm at 98.5km or so. And I start get that weird tunneling vision and it's getting ""dark"" in my head. My head hurts, and I am probably doing 40 RPM, and about 5 MPH at about a 4% grade. Things are not looking good, but I'm less than a mile away. I make it up the first two little ""hills"".

But, the last 500 yards of my ride home has a hill. About 8% grade. It's not very long. Maybe 200 yards long.

But I'm not gonna make it. Period. Like, I stopped, looked at the hill, put my bike down, and sat down, head in hands.

I make the call of shame to my wife, and tell her I really need to pick me up. She asks me where I'm at. I tell her I'm 4 blocks away. She asks me if I can make it.

Not a chance in hell.

I'm right now on the side of the street where she can't stop, so I roll downhill to a nearby parking lot, and just sit.

I can't tell you if it was 2 minutes or 30. I don't remember getting in the car. I don't remember how we got my bike in the truck. But, I do remember slamming two Cokes and suddenly feeling better.

So, in conclusion: Pack enough food, and then double check. And if you have three strikes, stop at the nearest bar, and just embrace that you're not gonna make it.

99.8km, btw.",cycling,2023-08-08 03:49:57

It takes a lot of force to break your femur! And it popped out of my leg! I have had 8 surgeries on it. It was a chronic non union. After every surgery I was put back in a wheel chair for 3 months. It was a lot. Shortly after my wreck I needed some cardio. I put my old cruiser bike on a trainer. That first day (4 years ago) I rode for 4 minutes. That's all I could do. I had to put a special adapter (an ortho-pedal) on it because of my leg. But I kept riding. And training. And doing my physical therapy! My first goal was to ride 20, then 30....

1619706959.0,Yesterday I was overtaken by every single cyclist I came across on my 20k ride,"Yesterday evening I went for a 20k ride (11k up and down) on this popular cycling road just outside my town. It's poular because it's like a perfect road, wide with plenty of space on the hard shoulder, mostly straight, with a few slight hills that wave up and down throughout the whole 11k stretch of road, and the scenery on either side is beautiful.

As I was pushing myself to get up the first of these small hills into a headwind, this giant of a man just flies past me at a ridiculous speed. His calves were the size of my thighs, and I'm 250lbs so my legs are pretty big. Then another guy flies past. Then a couple of women fly past while talking about their day, as if they're not giving any effort at all.

Turns out it was cycling rush hour, after everybody got off work, on the most popular cycling road in the area. I just stared in amazement as all these people passed me by. It's insane the speed they were all going at. I was even passed by someone who I'd say was at least 3 times older than me, and it also looked like he was just trotting along without putting in much effort.

Then, on my way back I was passed by that barn sized guy with calves of steel a second time. He managed to do 2 laps of that road while I still haven't completed 1. 

In that moment I got so excited for what the future holds, and that one day I will be zooming it down that road just as fast as the rest of them.

1614813612.0,UPDATE: Female Cyclist Getting Dropped: No longer getting dropped. :),"hi yall

4 months ago I made this post because I was getting discouraged at tough/all male very fast group rides. [https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/j6qb4g/female\_cyclist\_getting\_dropped\_need\_encouragement/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/j6qb4g/female_cyclist_getting_dropped_need_encouragement/)

I just wanted to briefly post an update which I hope may be helpful for other female cyclists in my situation: I'm not getting dropped anymore :)  ! Sometimes on super tough rides with crazy crosswinds I will get dropped, but now if I'm getting dropped so are other dudes. I'm definitely able to hold my own now. Heres some things that really helped me out/good advice I got that actually worked!

1. Do Intervals. Started doing Sweet Spot/Vo2 Max intervals once a week, that helped
2. Increase my FTP. I started lifting weights and increased my FTP from 160 to about 195 over 4 months, which is a big improvement/helped me a lot strength wise with surges. (I'm 123-125  pounds for reference, so that's about 3.5 watt/kg)
3. Rode less. Honestly I think i was overtraining and riding too many miles every week: giving myself way more time to recover/making sure to do Zone 2 or take recovery days helped. Cutting down my riding to an hour and just doing 1 long 60+ mile ride on the weekend helped. I ride about 150-170 miles a week now which is a good amount for me (before it was like >200 ish)
4. **Number 1 thing that helped!!!!!:** **figure out how to ride in a pack.** If you are small women like me riding with big stronger men on flat ground with 0 elevation, I cannot overstate this. Cycling is super fun but its also kind of crazy because you're just thrown in with people that are way stronger and more skilled than you are. Its like 50% strength, 50% skill. If you're small, you need to figure out the dynamics of pack riding. For me, understanding **where** surges were happening, **when** they were happening, and also what wheels I should get behind/who was a good draft really helped me. Never be in the front but never be in the very back either: the yo yo effect is real and you’ll get shot off. Focusing on **coasting less** and maintaining a **higher cadence** was helpful because I didn't have to exert as much energy when the group would surge if I was just continuously pedaling smoothly. I made a lot of friends too and they were always willing to give me a pull/lend me a wheel. Also honestly **don't pull.** One day I'll be strong enough too, but not yet. If i get stuck in a rotating pace line i just try to hold my position and have the other stronger guys rotate around me. Other small things that helped was shifting down at lights (because dudes I ride with love to just full throttle it when the light turned green again lol), and trying to be in the drops as much as possible to get a more aero draft. 

To all the weird male cyclists that commented/messaged me from the last post and told me ""women are biologically inferior to men, I should stop trying etc. etc."":  you're wrong. Yes, if we're comparing Cat 1-2 women to men there isn't a competition, but for the VAST majority of cyclists that isn't the kind of riding they are doing. Cycling is a very male dominated sport, especially group riding. To other female cyclists, don't be discouraged! I got dropped for like 3 months, but very slowly and with persistence I got stronger. I am a good athlete but was never the type to just hop on a bike and be strong: I had to work really hard. But its 100% possible and I would encourage every single female cyclist to keep coming out if you get dropped on these fast rides: you can do it!!!",cycling,2021-03-03 23:20:12
1624667235.0,Update:,"Exactly a week ago I attempted to save a person who went into cardiac arrest while cycling.

1624888430.0,A life-changing ride (please read),"Two Friday's ago, my dad (59) came to visit me. He is an avid mountain biker and runner, and is in great shape. He's been trying to get into road biking as well since I am a road biker.  He's been wanting to come visit and go for a road ride with me for a while now, and two friday's ago, we made that happen. I built out a nice route, and we headed out.

About 12 miles into the ride, he tells me he isn't feeling well and asks to turn around. At this point, we are pretty much in the woods with no one around. We go back about half a mile when he stops again, lays down, and asks me to call an ambulance for him. 5 minutes later he passes out, starts convulsing, and is obviously having a heart attack. At this point I am in shock, and am unsure what to do next as I have never had any CPR training. I do a few chest compressions and a few mouth-to-mouth breaths, which seem to help, and thankfully a few bystanders run over and start performing CPR (they seem to know what they're doing). About 5 minutes later, the ambulance arrives and we go to the ER. They are able to find a pulse in the ambulance. He is taken in for an emergency stent in the cav lab, and the cardiologist tells me that he had a 100% blockage of the LAD artery, and went into cardiac arrest because of this. This is one of the worst heart attacks you can have. He tells me that there is less than a 30% chance of him waking from this, and an even less chance of waking without major brain damage due to lack of oxygen to the brain. I call my mother and my brother, who both live 2 hours away (my mother is actually on vacation at the beach at the time). They both head over and arrive within a few hours.

He is then taken into the ICU where they begin something called Hypothermia Protocol, where they lower his body temperature significantly for 24 hours, then slowly warm him back up. He is on a ventilator during this, but his body and organs seem to be doing well. The doctor seems a bit optimistic, but isn't sure, as this doesn't always work, especially for a STEMI as serious as this.

He is unconscious during the cooling and warming period, which lasted about 2 days. Sunday night, he begins to open his eyes. Monday, he is moving a bit, is a bit agitated, but making some purposeful movements, and is trending in the right direction. Though his eye are not tracking, so there is still a high chance of major brain damage. Tuesday is more of the same, moving around a bit more, and is off the vent, but still isn't awake. Wednesday he begins to speak. Wednesday night he's alert and talking to us. He can't believe he is in a hospital and has no recollection of what happened. One of his first questions upon waking was ""when can I mountain bike again?"".

He continues to improve on Thursday and Friday. Having full conversations, remembers who we are, has the majority of his memories except for some short-term things from the last 2 months. Begins walking around on his own, eating on his own, and making calls to people.

Saturday he is moved from the ICU to a regular room, and is scheduled to be discharged in the next few days and to go to rehab. Though he is in such great shape right now that they don't think he'll need to be there at all. He's basically himself, aside from some random memory gaps, which should improve in time.

This recovery has been nothing short of a miracle, and the doctors were even in shock on how well and quickly this happened.  I ended up finding the 2 guys that helped perform CPR that day, and they both just happened to be driving by at the right time, and were both CPR certified (one guy was even a former EMT). Someone was truly looking out for us that day. If we had been even half a mile further on our ride, there would have been no one around. If he hadn't come to visit me, he would have had this alone in his home. Everything single thing that needed to go right went right, and he is alive to tell this story because of it.

This has been an incredibly difficult week for my family, but this outcome is nothing short of a miracle. This is a great reminder for everyone to never ride without a cell-phone, and to even get CPR certified if you can. The first minutes after an event like this will determine live or death. Had people not acted so promptly, he likely is not alive today. You never think something like this is going to happen until it does. He had no history of heart issues or high cholesterol. tHad he not been in such great shape, he likely doesn't recover from this either. About a month ago my wife and I told him that he's going to be a grandfather for the first time, so we are beyond happy that he is going to be alive to meet them.

The work the doctors and nurses did was nothing short of amazing. I have a new-found respect for ICU nurses and the work they do. The doctor was actually a cyclist as well, and even has ridden with the bike group I ride with a few times (I didn't know him before this). He wants to go on a victory ride with me once this is all over.

I just bought some cheapo Walmart bike because I wasn't sure how I'd like it, but now I wish I had splurged a little more. My plan is to ride this one til the wheels fall off (hopefully figuratively), then get a serious upgrade.


I've been doing a 6 mile ride every morning and having a blast doing it. I'm going to try adding to that distance little by little as I get more endurance.


This is the most fun I've ever had ""exercising"" and I think this might be a turning point in my life. Thanks for being nice to us bike noobs, I know I'm one of many",cycling,2020-07-13 21:36:56

1592262344.0,I'm riding 520 km (323 miles) in 24 hours to raise funds for my friend who is now quadriplegic after being struck by vehicle while cycling.,"Hi /r/cycling!

**Support:**

You can support Shim through our [website](https://www.shimsride.ca) by donating directly or by purchasing cycling kit - we've made a \*tasteful\* tie-dye [jersey and buff](https://www.shimsride.ca/shop). All proceeds from product sales go directly to Shim.

Our fundraising goal is $40,000. All money raised will be used to pay for epidural stimulation treatment, a surgery performed in Thailand, which has garnered limb mobility for previous patients.

**About:**

As the title suggests, I'm looking for your support to raise money for my friend, roommate, and teammate. Mathew (a.k.a. Shim) was struck by a motor vehicle while out on his bike and suffered a spinal cord injury, resulting in paralysis from the neck down.

**The Ride:**

On July 25th, myself and two friends will be riding from tip to tip of Vancouver Island, B.C., Canada (Port Hardy - Victoria) in one day. This ride is symbolic of Shim's willingness to take on new challenges and his level of community outreach.

1596971870.0,Unspoken rule: Always save your fellow cyclist if they are doing the walk of shame.,"Yesterday pulling out of our driveway, my SO noticed a cyclist at the bottom of our street who seemed to have a few people stopped around him. These bystanders quickly left as the cyclist waddled over to the side of the road in his cleats waving them off. I looked at my SO and we had the same thought...“Save this man from the walk of shame”. We pulled up and offered to give him a ride as we had nowhere to be. He was bright red and stammering out of embarrassment but we insisted he hop in. We lightly joked about how he has to burn his kit so nobody will recognize him as he explained what happened (He snapped his chain while trying to beat a car across our busy intersection and took a digger because he couldn’t unclip fast enough.) We made a new friend and saved someone from the walk of shame.

1621774973.0,Wind is the worst part of riding - change my mind,"Yesterday I had my longest ride yet, a full metric century. The route I usually take is almost perfectly split, 50k uphill to the next closest town, then 50k downhill back home. I live next to the second largest wind-formed basin in the world, so extreme winds become the norm. That is, until I started biking.

Took me 2 hours to go the first 50k with about 80% of the total vert. Then, it took about 4 hours to go the second 50k into sustained 20-30 mph winds. There is nothing more demoralizing than going 7 mph (working hard) down a hill you have previously gone 30+ mph down. My average speed was 7-8 mph slower going downhill than uphill because of the wind.

1662301007.0,Well it finally happened… I was hit by a car,"On Friday afternoon I decided to go on a ride following a 40 mile route I had completed countless times and was very comfortable on. The last thing I remember is crossing over the crest of a hill on the last 10 mile stretch of my route. I woke up 4 hours later in the ER in a neck brace, and I was told I had been hit by a driver and had sustained a compression fracture in my spine and a concussion. Nobody at the hospital could give me any details beyond that, and I have no recollection of the accident itself. 

When calling the local Police station they told me unsympathetically that the driver was given a citation but was not charged since it was deemed accidental. Their defense was that they did not see me due to the glare of the sun. Fortunately I am still able to walk, but I’ll have a long road to recovery and my decision to wear a helmet undoubtably saved my life. I bike to work everyday and go on long rides over the weekends, and yet now I can’t imagine ever riding on the road again.

I wanted to share my experience with this community to remind everybody that even if you do everything right and follow all precautions you are at the mercy of the drivers around you who can take everything from you in a second.",cycling,2022-09-04 14:16:47
1593171976.0,Any other cyclists here that dislike running?,"I've always enjoyed cycling and pushing myself up hills and what not even if it is tough, so I have no problems with pushing myself. I used to lift weights so am used to pushing through mental pain barriers. In essence I enjoy the aspects of working hard to try and attain some level of physical fitness.

For whatever reason running just never feels the same as other activities; I get bored very, very quickly and don't find it very good for me, emotionally/spiritually or physically. In fact physically running feels somewhat degenerative to me.

I think it may be to do with how I treat cycling, pushing hard up the hills is like an ""interval"" and coasting down is the reward/break, not to mention cycling does feel more like an escape, more often than not.

I'm aware many cyclists also do some running but wondering if there's people like me that enjoy cycling but don't particularly enjoy running?

1592913134.0,"Please, please be careful out there.","Yesterday while out cycling alone I came across an accident involving another cyclist. It had happened just moments before I arrived and at first glance it didn’t look all that serious, and I initially considered cycling on as it seemed like the 4 people already with the guy, one of whom was his daughter, had things under control. 

I stopped anyway just to ask if they could use a hand and it turned out that the cyclist was seriously wounded. I went over did what little I knew to do and got a towel to apply pressure to the wound. Sadly, despite our efforts, he passed away right there on the roadside, with his daughter who was cycling with him, by his side and holding his hand. Emergency services arrived soon after and did everything they could to revive him but I think the injury was just too severe.

I won’t share details of what happened here but I think it would be fair to describe what happened as a freak accident - no other vehicles were involved, nor do I believe what happened was the result of any type of carelessness or excessive speed. The man was a keen, experienced cyclist who just became a victim of a tragic misfortune and a less than perfect road surface and light conditions.

I’m sharing this as a reminder of the potential dangers of the sport, often related to things totally out of our control, and to encourage others to be careful when you’re out on your bikes. For your sake as well as that of your families and loved ones.

I think it’s also an important reminder that if we come across an accident and emergency services haven’t yet arrived, then it’s our responsibility to stop to at least ask if they need help. I very nearly made the assumption that I would have just been getting in the way and I would have been totally wrong about that. 

The others at the scene later told me that in the short space of time between the accident occurring and me coming by, several cyclists and cars had passed without so much as slowing. I think this in particular would have upset the poor daughter who was desperately trying to help her dear dad while people breezed past. 

I don’t believe there was really anything more any of us could have done to save that man’s life but at least we tried. And somehow, even through the deep shock and grief she must have been experiencing, the daughter expressed her deep gratitude to us for stopping.

Finally, massive shout out to the police and ambulance service who attended the accident. Every single one of them showed incredible sensitivity, kindness and compassion, not only to the daughter but also to the rest of us who were present at the scene. 

Stay safe out there.

1684791598.0,UPDATE: Cycling 100 miles without training,"Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/13o5ih0/cycling\_100\_miles\_without\_training/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/13o5ih0/cycling_100_miles_without_training/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

[Pic at finish line (or city)](https://ibb.co/x3YvRCY)

So a lot of people were asking about an update on my previous post about biking 100 miles without training, due to a bet with my dad. I did already do an update in the r/Denmark subreddit but since it's in danish it's kinda pointless. So anyway my adventure today:

I woke up at 6, had a bowl of oatmeal and then started off applying a THICK layer of vaseline down in the lower parts (thanks to u/s32 and others). I did some stretching and some route-research until about 7:30 when I took off. The morning was however very very chaotic as I had to find out how to bring the ""essentials"" with me, as I did not want to carry a bag with me. So I ended up taping a small headset bag to my bike (very poor solution but it did work) [picture of that](https://ibb.co/ftDnDVG). I ended up stuffing it with 2 small sandwich (which were very compressed), a bottle of water and my credit card. A lot of people were also asking about what bike I rode and it was a Single Speed Elops City Bike [this one](https://ibb.co/0JyXjRt). I also did not have bike shoes so I used my old sneakers. Anyways the trip:

The first ""stage"" was to a city named Køge (around a 28 km route), took me about 1h10m after which I stopped at the local fitness to refill my water and then wasted 30 minutes looking for some equipment for my bike which I had forgotten haha. I think I spent like 1 hour scrambling around in Køge, which was kinda embarrasing.

Next up was another 26-27 km route to Ringsted, in which I also stopped briefly to refill my water. At this point I still felt great and had no pain at all, though the sun was starting to make its presence known (especially around my neck).

I then did the next 50km from Ringsted to Korsør, in which I stopped briefly once or twice to buy 3 small chocolate frogs from a supermarket (my favs) and a very bad danish cola, which I chugged quickly. At this point my eyes were getting red (idk why) and I had some tension in my back and neck, but nothing too bad. I then hopped on the train for 12 minutes to get over the water to Nyborg, and then I proceeded to bike the last 30km to Odense. I felt great afterwards and had no butt or leg pain, which was extremely surprising to me, but maybe the wind was on my side today. I then went to surprise my grandparents who live in Odense =D overall a great day and I got to enjoy some gorgeous danish nature.

Some stats for you animals: I started at 7:30 and arrived at 15:30 (would've arrived at 15:00 but had to take a detour), I had approx 1 hour of rest. So that makes it an avg. speed of around 22-23 kph, which I'm very content with.

Big thanks to all of you guys for all your kind words and encouragement!! I will now spend the night thinking how I can spend the 300 dollars in the most teenage-rebellious way",cycling,2023-05-22 21:39:58

Nothing, it continues to move and I can feel it. Home is about 20 minutes away, I'm wondering if I can ride that far before it damages my ear drum or I go insane. In desperation I grab a stick and try to pry it out like a cuetip, no dice. I am vaguely aware of people around me looking at me like I'm probably insane on meth. I decide I might have to ride home and have my wife tweezer it out, but as a last effort I open up my camel back and pour my water straight into my ear.

1596605482.0,My Father Got Hit by a Truck,"Hello Everyone,

I wanted to come on this Sub and tell everyone my experience of my father's serious biking accident.

It was July 20th 2020 at around 11:35AM. My father and I were in a park cycling to go down to a workout spot in the inner harbor of my city. There is a long ramp that goes back and forth to get from the top of the trail hill down to the bottom. After you come out of the ramp there is a street that you have to cross to continue on the trail. The only issue is that there are these huge bushes that create a blind spot for people about to cross the street and the cars. So, one has to come out to see if there are any cars coming.

We had been riding this route for a while, and due to Covid-19 and construction on the street, there were hardly any cars that came up the road. My father was a little ahead of me so, I did not see him get hit but I did hear him get hit. I'm assuming, based off what the drivers said and where he was laying, that he rode out thinking that no cars would come and when he got out into the street, the truck was already close to him. So, instead of him trying not to get hit head on, he took a sharp right turn in between the truck and the bushes. The driver panicked and swerved left when he saw my father coming out. This meant that the back end of the truck is what hit my dad.

I was coming down the ramp and as I got to towards the end of it I heard a fairly loud noise that sounded like when you slam a car door shut. I looked over and saw the truck slowing down to a complete stop. Something in me told me that something had happened. It felt like a part of me had just dropped. I slowed down and looked out on the road to see my father laying on the ground.

I couldn't believe what I was seeing,and I really thought he was dead. The passenger in the truck got out and as I was getting off my bike, I yelled ""Aww fuck man!"" to him and ran over to my dad. He was laying on his stomach and his head was bleeding out as he had a huge gash on the right side of his head. It was shaped kind of like Harry Potter's scar but just bigger. His bike in the bushes all bent, the right side of his helmet was completely gone, in pieces over the ground and his book bag was laying near him. I immediately called 911 and told the drivers to call 911. The operator told me to take a dry cloth and put pressure on the wound. I took out my dry shirt from my book bag and put the pressure on his head. The operator was asking me if he was conscience but I was so overcome with emotion that I had forgotten what that meant. Looking back, he was not conscience at all but he was breathing very hard. It sounded like he was snoring. I told the operator that he was Snoring(Again emotions were running wild and I couldn't think straight) The operator told me to try to wake him up and not let him go to sleep. I was telling him ""I need you to be strong right now dad. Do not go Sleep. Stay with me. I know you hear my voice. Come on dad wake up. Wake up. Be strong with me right now!"" .The ambulance came in about 8 minutes but it felt like 15 minutes. They took control of the situation and he's been in Shock Trauma for three weeks now. Unconscious still, kind of in a Semi-Coma State, **But Alive!**

He suffered serious brain damage to the right side of his brain, a broken lower back(No paralysis, thank god), a shattered left collar bone and a deep cut on his right side of his neck.

The doctors don't know when he is going to wake up, it could be a next month. But they do know that he will have some permanent mental disabilities and physical disabilities on his left side of his body for the rest of his life. I'm 20 years old and I know that life is going to be different for my family and him but, I'm just happy that he is alive.

It has been very hard for me, to really do anything but cry, watch Netflix, YouTube videos and listen to music. I'm trying to get counseling soon.  I wanted to come on here tell everyone to always be aware of your surroundings and to always wear a helmet. For If my father did not have a helmet on, he would have been dead.

I love you all, I love cycling and I wish you the best in life.

EDIT:Thank you all for your support. Im feeling more motivated. No matter where you are in life, keep building yourself. If I want to help my dad out I have to keep building myself up, so that I can be strong to support him and the people around me.",cycling,2020-08-05 05:31:22
1653350721.0,"Yesterday I rode my bike 318 miles straight from Seattle, WA to Eugene, OR","BIG day. Planned this ride as a fundraiser for a Eugene-based nonprofit, Diabetes Community Care Team (I myself have type 1 diabetes). Put in a good pace (17.5mph average) but had too many stops which delayed my arrival time quite a bit. Left at 4am from Seattle and got in to Eugene at 2:40am.

Strava says 315.5 due to accidental pausing for a few miles. For the curious, here's the ride: [Pedal for Pat | Ride | Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/7188986628)

The sleepiness was really starting to set in near the end, and an hour of rain at mile 270 made me really question my sanity. Overall though, a great experience. The main challenge for me was some pretty severe IT band issues which set in around mile 200, and got progressively worse. The pain was barely manageable even with 800mg of ibuprofen on board and 1g of Tylenol.

There is something uniquely punishing about continuing to ride into the dark after already riding 200ish miles. I actually felt fantastic after mile 200 and thought I may continue to feel like that. Oh boy, was I wrong.

This was by far my longest ride ever (previous record was 200 miles). Feel free to ask me anything about my preparation/training etc. Here's a bit on the basics:

Food: primarily ate Clif bars, candy, and Grandma's Cookies. I've found that while ""real"" food does tend to make me feel a bit better, scum-of-the-earth, sugar-laden foods are easier for me to get down and eat consistently. Ultimately, consistency > food quality when it comes to my performance. Oh, also lots of caffeine pills, which in my mind fit in a similar health category as convenience store candy and Grandma's Cookies. 

\^Edit:: I REALLY want to emphasize that simply eating lots is HUGE for performance on rides like this. I used to be the guy who would do 100-milers with nothing more than half a PB+J, but I've learned that fueling adequately (even with shit food) works wonders for how you feel 6, 12 hours down the road. 

Training: was doing 300mpw for 3-4 weeks of mostly zone 2, with one threshold workout (or Zwift race with focus on this zone) and one long ride per week. I worked up from 100-mile long ride to a 200-miler, which was the STP route. Sadly, I started experiencing pretty bad patellofemoral syndrome and had to back off a LOT on the mileage, so ended up training at only 100-140 mpw for the 5 weeks leading up to the ride.

Edit:: adding this on since I thought it was a fun question. I think I probably burned around 12-14k calories. While my Strava estimated power was 138 watts, I’ve found strava power estimates to be garbage in terms of accuracy. When I had a power meter I found the Strava estimate to read 25% lower than reality. Taking what is probably closer to my real average, 138/.75=184 watts, which is firmly in my zone 2 range, 12-14k calories is about what I probably burned. Still digging my way out of that deficit!",cycling,2022-05-24 00:05:21

1606237031.0,Thoughts on buying first road bike.,"Lots of people are interested in taking up cycling these days, and many come here seeking advice on buying their first road bike.  I've ridden for 40+ years, and thought I'd try and start a thread to share thoughts and possibly help.

The most important single piece of info I can offer road bike shoppers is to adjust your mindset as follows: this is your FIRST road bike, not ""THE"" road bike for all time.  There is a huge amount of choice in bikes, for excellent reason: they're not at all the same.

When you're starting out, it's hard to appreciate the significance of (say) an endurance frame vs. a more race-oriented frame.  If you're just learning to ride, you may not feel the differences between the 105 and Ultegra Shimano groupsets ... to say nothing of various flavors of Campagnolo.

And that's how it's supposed to be.  Your first bike needs to be good enough to learn on, but it won't anticipate the rider you will be in 2, 5, 10 years as you accumulate experience.  Which bike you 'should' get is about who you are as a rider, and as a noob, you really haven't had the chance to develop that.

In fact, it's highly likely that if you ride regularly (several times a week), after a few years you'll want a new bike.  One that reflects your newfound experience and - most importantly - your personal preferences.  Road bikes are like cars - they all sorta do the same thing (point A to point B) but in hugely different ways.  As there is no ""best car for everyone"" there is no best bike.

Most of the posts about 'which bike of these three' are about components and/or features.  These are important, and easy to post about (hence a popular discussion starter), but obscure the reality: you simply need a *good* bike.  Most 'which bike?' posts I see have one thing in common: overspending on the first bike.  

Purchasing a BMC Roadmachine or Giant TCR or Specialized Tarmac as a first bike means you are wagering on two unlikely things:  that your inexperienced first choice is the best, and that you know exactly what kind of rider you'll be once you're more experienced.

So: your FIRST bike is your LEARNING bike.  This does not mean you shouldn't have a GOOD bike - but you should be thinking along the lines that ""in a few years, I'm likely to want another.""  Whether you keep the first bike or begin to develop the N+1 addiction is for another conversation.  But foremost, it means this: DON'T OVERSPEND ON YOUR FIRST BIKE.  Nothing could be worse than getting a $5k bike and realizing that you would've preferred a different type of frame geometry.  Or that you just don't like riding.

So: how to put that mindset into action?  Buy used, or try to obtain a more moderately spec'd bike.  This is both pandemic-specific but also general advice.  I'm not saying to dive into the seamy underbelly of Craig's List, but try your local bike shop or co-op, or a reputable dealer of used bikes like Pro's Closet (not an endorsement, but I do think they have good selection and do a great job).  

Shimano's 105 groupset is more than adequate for learning; and personally I always think it's good to learn on caliper brakes but hey, I'm an old man.  Let's not discuss frame materials - it leads to conversations as cheerful and sensible as political discussions at family holiday meals.  Suffice to say: any frame you get from a reputable seller is almost certain to be adequate for the purpose of your learning.

The differences between a bike like that and a $5k, super-nice carbon-framed road machine with Ultegra Di2 and disc brakes ... is something you'd *appreciate* right away, but not really use.  And let's face it: you want to save that money for your SECOND, ""more serious"" bike.  (LOL - this is a definite progression, wait and see!).  And then your THIRD.  And fourth ... 

DON'T get a crappy bike.  And no matter what the bike is made of, do your best to ensure it's structurally safe.  Make sure a good bike mechanic gives it a thorough look when you get it.   And make sure you understand the importance of fit - simply learning how to fit yourself to a bike should be a HUGE part of your learning experience within the first thousand miles of riding.

Learn to ride.  This does not mean ""pedaling faster.""  At the risk of irritating a healthy segment of the sub, I'm going to say that Zwift / Peloton / etc. are wonderful, and do a great job of increasing cycling fitness levels ... but also omit parts of riding that are crucial: the experience of riding on the road.

Learn how to be safe.  Hint: situational hyper-awareness is the key.

Learn how to maintain your bike.  Not only will this make you more self-sufficient, but it will also speed your understanding of what you do and don't want in your ""second, more serious"" bike. Anyone who drives should know how to put gas in their car; anyone who rides should be able to change a tire, clean and lube a chain, adjust a limit screw ... and you will start to learn about the minute details of your and other bikes, and how they're actually quite different.

Finally, you will develop form.  Your back may become more flexible, as you learn to 'get aero.'  Or it may not! - and you will learn that you like a 'more relaxed geometry' for that ""second, more serious"" bike (hello, Specialized Roubaix).  You will learn to use the entirety of the revolution of the pedal, not just stomp between 2 and 5 (if this sounds like gibberish, just wait).  And you will learn how to alter your form and make micro-adjustments (to cadence, to body position) to meet the demands of your current environment.

That's a lot to cover, and it helps to not be learning these lessons on a bike that represents an investment equivalent to a down payment on a condo.

You're going to screw up a maintenance task.  You will learn hard lessons about tires, pinch flats, Uber availability when it's raining, and oblivious drivers (FFS, please realize that it's better to be alive than 'right').  And just like most of us who've ridden forever, you'll begin a lifelong process of seeking The Perfect Saddle, which has been waiting for you like a princess in a castle, ready to nestle your tender nether parts so that you don't get hot spots in mile 38 of your 60 mile ""fun ride.""  (Sorry, here: it doesn't exist, kind of like the princess)

You'll also figure out who you are on the bike.  Competitive?  Love to suffer on endless climbs?  Can't stand that shit, and just want to get around town while staying heart-healthy?  They're all viable choices, and far from mutually exclusive.

But the key is that until you gain riding experience, you're not going to learn the things that you need to know to appreciate the myriad differences in road bikes.  You just need to start, and preferably on something affordable but good.

Cycling is an activity that can offer great emotional, physical and psychological benefits.  Like most complex activities, there are no shortcuts: you must do it for a while to gain experience.

Rules for buying new/first road bike:

1.  No ""projects.""  You need a bike that has no issues.  Used bikes should not be beat-to-hell, and parts should be readily available.  

2.  Solid groupset.  105/Rival are a great level to target.

3.  Sizing.  Not going into the whole ""professional fitting"" trend - if you can afford/obtain, fine.  Otherwise, do the research.  Far and away the most important thing in obtaining your first road bike is to have one that is appropriately sized for you.

4.  Save the money you'd spend on a 'THE' road bike for the inevitable ""SECOND, MORE SERIOUS"" road bike.  Set a goal for when you're going to buy it (after 5k miles?).

5.  Budget for a new saddle, tires, shoes, pedals, accessories.  Cycling isn't cheap.

6.  Budget TIME for all of these things.  

Hope this may help.

1652747487.0,I was a drug addict 39 days ago,"I got a free, fucked up bike, from the church up the road.

But cycling is giving me back me health, building up confidence I havent had in years, stamina, and encouraging me to get up and go, it's so fun. I rode a shitty used bike 1 mile to my dealer and 1 mile home, for a couple years, and was gassed out making that trip every day. The past few days I've been working off the bike to build strength, and today I conquered 5 miles in under 20 minutes and when I got off the bike all I could think was Kroger is only 2 miles away, I could get a Gatorade or something and come back home. I didn't. I don't wanna push too hard, idk what that would have been like, it's a lot more hill that way, than the gentle slope and flat ride I had jus taken.

1601299980.0,PSA: Do not ride with your expensive phone on the handlebars. You will destroy your camera.,"I keep getting asked about this whenever I happen to mention it, so I thought I would put up a thread about it - don't put your expensive phone on your handlebars (regardless of the mount). Vibrations and shocks induced by riding will damage your phone's camera's focus mechanism over time. 

This is a common issue for motorcycle and bicycle riders both, there are plenty of discussions about it on reddit and internet at large, so now that you are aware do your research.

_________________

For a personal anecdote - I researched the very topic before I started using a phone on the handlebars and having been warned it is dangerous I opted for a cheap second-hand Samsung Galaxy S5 (oldest/cheapest with ANT+ and water resistance) instead of my expensive primary - the S5 lasted around 1 year of ~40 km daily riding before its camera stopped focusing.

- register your bike’s serial numbers and pictures (update as you add components)

- be excellent to each other. I really liked the bike but it was nice seeing the owner’s face light up when it was returned.",cycling,2020-06-20 14:30:12
1620315808.0,To all my fellow cyclists,"I work in a hospital where there was an bicycle accident victim (bicycle vs. motor vehicle). I have overhead some assholes (hospital workers) talk about how they “don’t even feel bad” for the cyclist who is in bad shape since he was not “following the rules of the road”. Obviously, no one knows what happened, but this really angered me and made me think a lot about what we are up against.

We take risks when we get on a bicycle or a car. However, we are outnumbered. We share the road with many people who feel they have some sort of ownership of the road. When someone makes a mistake (cyclist or driver) people will not hesitate to point fingers and blame cyclists not drivers. Again, we are outnumbered. Even people who are supposed to have your best interest at heart (in a hospital) will not be on your side. There is a huge bias against bicyclists and when we get in a accident, only few will be on your side. Not the police, not the drivers at the scene, not the people that will take care of you at the hospital. 

Best we can do is ride carefully and not aggressively. Respect the size of what you are up against (cars and the vast amount of drivers). Even when cars treat us like assholes; we must keep in perspective that when we get hurt, no one is going to give a shit.

Do your best to ride safely. Support your local cycling group and their efforts to make the roads safer for cyclists.

I’m a mechanic and service writer at a really high end shop on the front range of Colorado.

That’s all fine and good- after all this is the path I’ve chosen, but when living for bicycles all day you really begin to sweat the small stuff, like jagwire releasing a .8mm shift cable for dropper posts, Fox releasing a 150mm 31.6 transfer sl, SRAM lumping jockey wheel part numbers together, or Grant Peterson recommending kool stop e-bike pads.

This community, while it does certainly sweat the small stuff, includes the big stuff like people getting their first bike, and people doing their first half century. That kind of post really reminds me of how wonderful the cycling world is.

More details. The ride lasted 4h 35min, there was a closed road which slowed me down quite a bit. I have a decent road bicycle. I cycle in Finland so there isn't a lot of hills. 
I already posted about this on r/bicycling.

1645400129.0,Cycling completely fixed my mental health problems that I struggled with for years,"I had problems with my mood and general mental state for years. As a teenager I was diagnosed with chronic depression and social anxiety. I tried behavior therapy with a therapist for a while and it helped my anxiety a little but did nothing for my depression. Then they put me on SSRIs for the depression. Those made me go from hating everything to being indifferent toward everything and not caring about anything, which I think is only a marginal improvement. I took those for maybe a year then stopped. My chronic depression and constant low mood were gone at that point, and I was somewhat better off, but I still had mood problems. It was just like a constant on and off between feeling like complete shit and feeling amazing. My psychologist said it almost sounded like bipolar disorder but didn't meet the criteria since each phase was too short (like hours instead of weeks). When I was in the bad moods it was awful though. I would have this sense of dread come over me and suddenly start finding the things that were stressing me in life impossible to bear. I was also extremely irritable very often too and would become extremely annoyed over little things people would do. I knew it was irrational anger so I kept it to myself and didn't show it, but internally I'd be so irritated and it made me not want to be around people at all. It was also getting worse as time went on. I was spending more and more time in the lows and less and less in the highs.

Now I am 22 and picked up cycling about 6 months ago. Before that I was living an extremely sedentary lifestyle where I'd sit at a computer for 12+ hours a day. No exercise and hardly even any walking other than around the house and to and from my car. On the first day I went cycling I was in one of my low moods before I went. I had that feeling of dread and despair and being overwhelmed by stress. I went on the ride anyway and pushed myself. It was probably the first time I exerted myself physically in years. Anyway, while I was on the ride my mind was distracted from the stress. Nothing unexpected about that, of course. You're not going to be thinking and stressing about the future when your legs and lungs are burning like hell right now. But what was unexpected to me was what happened after. After I got back from the ride my low mood was completely gone. I just felt good and the sense of dread and despair was gone, and the problems that were stressing me so badly that I couldn't take it only an hour before now seemed like no big deal and nothing I couldn't handle. My irritability was also completely gone. Normally when I was in a low mood things like dogs barking unexpectedly would make me *extremely* annoyed. The anger felt like getting stabbed with a knife. But when my dog started barking like crazy at the mailman then I had zero emotional reaction.

At first I thought it was probably just a fluke. But I have been cycling for 6 months now and there has not been a single time where one of these random clouds of despair has come on me and didn't go away after I pushed myself on the bike. And not only that, but they appear much less frequently now. I went from entering one of these moods nearly every day for at least a few hours, to now where I get them probably once every 2 months on average, and it's usually when I'm having a very stressful week whereas before it took only the most minor of stressors.

I started cycling for the physical health benefits, and I have definitely seen those too, but the effects to mental health in my opinion are even much better. I would have had a much easier time in university if my psychologist would've prescribed me exercise instead of drugs. It works better and instead of having things like killing your sex drive and giving you sweaty hands as side effects it just improves your cardiovascular fitness.",cycling,2022-02-20 23:35:29

1691945094.0,Nearly died today,"I was doing a ride this morning in a neighborhood street. The speed limit is 30 mph. I saw and heard a car speeding and skidding around a sharp curve coming towards me. When i first saw the car, we were both in our own lanes with double yellow lines separating the lanes. The car was approximately 50 feet in front of me, doing approximately 50+ mph. I could tell the driver had lost a little control but hoped he/she would course correct or slow down. But they didn't. They kept coming fast, skidding into my lane. Closer and closer until i saw they were coming head- on at me at around 50 mph. At the last second, i jumped off the bike and dove into ground away from the curb and into a wooded area. I saw the car missed me by 1-2 feet as i dove away. The car never slowed down because they had clearly lost control around the sharp curve. I was relatively unscathed (few scratches), but my bike didn't make it. The car hit it straight head on. The front wheel ended mangled on a nearby tree, while the rest of my bike was totaled.

The worst part? Driver took off, never stopping. What's rubbing salt on my woulds? I had a go pro camera recording (On combo garmin edge / go pro front mount), but on impact, everything went flying into the wooded area, with tons of trees, dead leaves, vines, etc. I was able to find my Garmin edge, Garmin radar, air pump, water bottles, but not the go pro. The go pro surely caught the license plate (assuming it had a front one) and the make of car. But after searching for a few hours, i haven't been able to find it, neither by physically looking for it or using phone's bluetooth. So this asshole is going to get away b with a hit and run.

UPDATE. After hours of searching, including with two other people, and after buying a metal detector, no luck finding go pro. Maybe it flew into car's windshield or front end.

UPDATE 2. LINK to two photos. One shows the mangled front wheel on a tree, the other from my garage showing damage to top and bottom tubes.

1595078663.0,Doored and run over by a truck: my cycling accident,"Hey all,     (PHOTOS [https://imgur.com/a/091BqKv](https://imgur.com/a/091BqKv))

I (27 M) wanted to post about my accident for awhile as I feel it's important for all of us riders to be aware of the possible road dangers/the importance of wearing a helmet. Last September, I was biking to work on a normal sunny day and stopped at a red light. There was a giant semi-truck beside me, who rode parallel to me once the light turned green. Past the intersection, I could see there were a bunch of parked cars on the right side, but while it all happened so fast, I remember thinking ""there's enough space between the truck and parked cars for me to get through there"".

It was tight, but nothing crazy. I was going about 15kmph when a man opened his door extremely fast, a perfect timing where I smashed into his door, went flying ahead and sadly landed in the wheel of the moving semi-truck, which pulled my right arm under the wheel and alas, crushed my elbow. The only way to describe getting run over by a truck would be: I expected to just hit the ground but while mid-air, I felt like my body was being overtaken by something EXTREMELY heavy, as if suddenly my right arm was being twisted in some sort of grinder or metal machinery, although there was 0 pain. At the time, I remember traffic stopping and while lying on the pavement, I thought to myself  ""I'm dead or paralyzed at minimum"", feeling nothing. Wiggled my legs and felt some relief. My entire arm/hand immediately swelled to a size I didn't know was humanly possible. Guy who doored me just stood there, looking helpless but very panicked. Someone called 911, they came to the rescue and I remember just feeling so confused in the ambulance as I genuinely didn't believe a cyclist like me could be in this situation. In retrospect, having cycled daily for the past 4 years, I was clearly in a ""I'm invincible"" headspace where I truly felt that something like this could never happen to me. As for my GIANT bike, it simply had to get a new front wheel and was scratched, that's it.

Went to hospital, got x-rayed, feared that my arm would be amputated or something of that nature. Turns out I was lucky and just shattered my elbow, while my hand was somehow not shattered (apparently the grooves in tires can make it less likely to crush bones LOL). Went into surgery, got metal plates/screws to replace the shattered bone (comminuted fracture) and woke up a few hours later with incredible pain, a giant cast and a whole new life ahead of me. I wondered if I'd ever ride again, if I'd be able to play sports, play music... it was all too surreal but I couldn't process anything. That being said, I was grateful to still have my arm! The healing was hard but I felt confident in my ability to heal fully and was determined from day 1 to remain optimistic. I did physio 3 times a week, and kept at it ever since (now going once a week). Ate healthy, rested all throughout winter and although Corona fucked up my original plans, I was ready to get back on the saddle...

April 1st, I got back on my bike and just celebrated my 1000th KM since! I lost 10 degrees of full extension but my arm is slowly getting back to a new normal, can't complain at all. While the accident was so shit, I was never scared to get back on because I felt that I had gained a whole new perspective on life and on riding in general. After a wild year, I really want to share some final thoughts with all of you that I hope you will consider:

**-Wear a fucking helmet. I would be dead had I not been wearing mine.**

**-Don't commute with a laptop. Everything in my bag was destroyed.**

**-Don't listen to music while riding on busy streets. It's just asking for trouble.**

**-In those moments of quick-thinking, where you contemplate running the red light, or passing something fast, or feel you can just make it by a hair... fucking stop. Just stop. It's not worth it and I can tell you firsthand that while 95% of times you'll be fine, it's only a matter of time before you're in a stretcher. Risk-taking, adrenaline-rush riding is playing Russian roulette, no matter how fast and experienced you are.**

**-If you get injured, save all records, document license plates or make sure someone gets an incident report. While in the ambulance, I obviously couldn't think of those details but later I had to play detective to figure out all the details, person who doored me, license plates, insurances etc.**

**-Keep a distance from parked cars. Don't chance it, unless you have to, in which case, slow the fuck down to 5kmph and pass by.**

Stay safe guys and happy riding,X

When I walked for about 0.3 miles, someone came from behind and asked if I had a flat tire. When I looked back, there was this guy with one of his daughter on his bike and there were 2 more girls behind also riding a bike. They looked no older than 4 ish. 

The guy asked if I needed to pump my flat tire and I said I don't know if that would help because I didn't know how serious the puncture was and I also I didn't want to interrupt his time with his girls. 

He said he was on his way back home anyway, so I followed him and his little girls. The house was literally 30ft away from where we were. 

This guy was so generous to help out and while he was pumping the wheel, he said he has a truck so if pumping didn't work, he could just give me a ride. Thankfully, the pumping worked and I was able to ride back home. 

I just wanted to share this story because it was very kind of this random guy to help out a random person! He could've just went home with his 3 little girls, but no, he was willing to help out a stranger on the road and it helped me get back home before it got too dark.

He said the front tire was at 40 psi and the rear was 20-something and that the bike was unrideable due to the tire pressure. He put air in the tires and says it rides fine now, although I haven't ridden it yet because night just hit. He showed me how to put air in the tires. He said the bike seems fine, assembled ok and that it's fine to ride. So it's the simplest thing we suspected, 100% tire pressure. No wonder if was hard to ride lolol.

Joey was a great guy, he was always positive and upbeat, I never heard him complain about his condition, but his accident as a kid greatly affected his quality of life for the past 20+ years and ultimately took him from his friends and family far too soon. Brain injuries are always ugly and there is NO recovery from them, if they don't kill you right away they will wreak havoc on your life and may still kill you later.

*""(Reuters) - France will contribute 50 euros per person towards bicycle repairs after a nationwide coronavirus lockdown ends on May 11, taking an innovative step to encourage cycling and keep cars off city roads.*

*Environment Minister Elisabeth Borne announced on Thursday a 20 million euro ($22 million) plan for repairing bicycles, installing temporary bike parking spaces and financing cycling coaching sessions.*

*The government is keen to get more people cycling and reduce overcrowding in metros and buses, where it is hard to practice the social distancing required to prevent virus transmission.*

*Borne said the government will also accelerate a programme allowing employers to cover up to 400 euros of travel costs of staff who cycle to work.*

*“We want this period to be a new stage towards a cycling culture and we want the bicycle to be the queen of deconfinement,” Borne said on her Twitter feed.*

*French cycling federation FUB, which will coordinate the bike repair programme, said the government has prepared 300,000 cheques worth 50 euros for the repair programme and said the scheme would be extended if it is a success.*

*“Cycling can contribute to preventing a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic,” FUB’s president Olivier Schneider said.*

*Paris and other cities are also planning to create new bike lanes by taking space away from car lanes.*

*Pierre Serne, who coordinates the government’s cycling plan, told local radio France Bleu that the region around Paris plans to create up to 750 km of new bike lanes on departmental roads to make it easier for commuters to cycle in from towns outside the capital, notably on electric bikes for longer distances.*

*Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo said on Twitter the city will create new bike lanes along busy metro lines 1, 4 and 13. She also said that major east-west thoroughfare Rue de Rivoli will be reserved for cycling, with only buses, taxis and emergency vehicles allowed on it.*

*The city is also making plans to improve bike lane connections to the financial district of La Defense on the western side of Paris.*

*Paris currently has about 370 km of bike paths and the temporary lanes are expected to increase that to 650 km.""*

1679287460.0,My stolen bike has killed my desire to cycle,"So last week my bike was stolen. 

I was sound asleep when my front door camera went off around 2:00 am. I stumbled downstairs to find a couple at my front door, they informed me that they saw someone walking down our lane pushing a bike and that my garage door was open. 

I ran out to my garage and sure enough my almost new Canyon CF SL 8 was gone. 

I ran inside and told my wife and let her know I was going to go looking for it. I drove around the neighborhood for about an hour, went to all the spots I know where thieves like to hang out, and couldn't find them. While I was driving I spoke with the local RCMP and informed them of exactly what happened. They sent out patrols, but ultimately I heard nothing back.

The following morning I checked my insurance only to discover the new policy I signed only had $1000.00 of coverage per bike. Sigh. My fault for not looking more closely. But still disappointing.

I've been checking all the local marketplaces to try and find someone selling it to no avail. I've driven around looking for it. The RCMP has not called, although I was able to register the SN, so maybe one day it will show up. But I'm not holding my breath. 

I have no idea how they got in my garage, it was all locked up but according to my garage door app, the door was opened at 11:36 pm. So somehow it opened at that time and my bike was stolen around 2:00 am. 

Long story short, I saved up for this bike for years and I am in no position to replace it. I just don't have the heart to get back on my mountain bike and ride on the road again. (did that for 3 years)

The whole thing just feels so utterly futile. I'm sorry for the vent session, but I have no friends who cycle. I'm not part of any local groups. I just ride solo and I have no one to talk to who can even remotely understand why my bike was so important to me.

1607112025.0,GOT SMOKED BY AN ELECTRIC SKATEBOARD,"Dude passed me on a flat road and we both stopped at the red light. There is a short descent followed by a 1/4 mile uphill after the red light. I was ready to show him who's the boss on this bike lane.

Light turned green, we both had a good start. He was faster than me at the beginning but I knew that's the natural advantage of having an electric skateboard.  However, going into the descent, I still couldn't catch up with him.

I thought: ""Fine. Guess you are faster than most normie electric skateboarders, but there is no way your skateboard could produce that much power going uphill. I'm the local bully and top 200 record holder for this section on STRAVA."" Using the momentum from the descent, **I GAVE EVERYTHING I GOT** in the uphill, pedaling to 20+ mph.

Dude looked back at me, flicked a switch in his hands, and BOOM OFF HE WENT. His skateboard barely slowed down on the ascent, if not going even faster than before. I managed to shorten our gap to less than 1 bike length apart but I just didn't have anything left in my tank to catch up. I had to slow down at the top of the ascent because I was too burned off, and that dude just drifted further and further away.

I deserve some fried chicken tonight for my effort.

So I have really become comfortable by myself. Then last week I rode with a buddy. I found myself annoyed the whole ride. I felt like he was actually slowing me down. He kept talking to me, I finally said “hey I really have been working on this segment coming up, you care if I really attack it?” “Oh nah bro go on, I’ll catch up.” He says, so I just pushed myself to the absolute limit (pr!). It was silent I was happy. Am I a bad person? I mean I have PTS and asthma so I have been isolating and the rides has been my escape, so I think as a result I prefer to be alone these days.

1629243023.0,Got run over,"I started cycling about 3 weeks ago now. Sunday night, after the best ride yet and 10 minutes from home, a car failed to stop at what was a stop sign coupled with a bicycle path AND a pedestrian crossing. I was already engaged in crossing the street, I tried to avoid him as best as I could but he hit my rear wheel. 

I flew off the bike, landed on my back and hit the back of my head on the pavement. I think my helmet saved me from serious injury, it's cracked but my head is not. I spent the night in the hospital - in a cervical collar in a preventive measure - to confirm I didn't have spinal damage.

The driver won't face any consequences since he fled the scene as soon as I hit the ground and despite the fact that there were many witnesses, nobody was able to get a license plate or can even agree on what the car was (I thought it was a white Civic, one witness thinks it was a grey BMW).

This incident could have shattered my faith in humanity (which is already shaky at best) if not for the fact that, at least in my country, first responders and hospital staff are such nice people, it makes the whole experience a little more bearable. Also, I was lucky to have a very nice lady come to my rescue and stay with me while waiting for the first responders; she even offered to store my bike at her place until I could pick it up again.

I was able to get the bike fixed already, though I had to pay more because the only wheels available at the bike shop I frequent were Mavic and he couldn't get anything else (end of season, coupled with stock issues due to covid). So I have a wheel that cost 25% of the total cost of the bike. On the plus side, the all black wheel fits so well on my black bike, but it's making me want to match the front wheel (which now has grey spokes) with the rear one :D

1619269356.0,Cycling saved my mental breakdown,"I know this sounds hyperbolic, but it's really not. 

Towards the end of last year, I completely burnt out. I was hanging onto a relationship with someone I loved who didn't feel the same, we had moved out from our apartment and I decided to buy a place so I was working, visiting houses, moved 4 times in 5 months for sublets, the weather was shit, I was studying for exams to get my residency, work was crushing me, I couldn't visit my family due to covid, etc. 

Around the end of December, for the first time in my 30 year life I just... bent/broke. Couldn't get out of bed for 2 days, and just broke down. 

In February my gf of 4-5 years broke up with me, and now I'm dealing with a house renovation that is stressing the ever living fuck out of me.

But at the very end of March I bought a used bike (Specialized Allez Elite) and did my first ride, a 40km loop in the rain, and 30-40kph wind. The guy who sold it to me decided after two rides he didn't like road bikes (the bike was 2nd hand already) so I got all his gear which also fits me. Jersies, bib shorts, gloves, glasses, shoes (clipless), etc. I only needed to buy a helmet and water bottle!

Since then I set myself some goals (100km ride, 1000km total, and 30kph average over an hour+ ride). I've done a 105km ride, I've rode over 600km already, and well the last...that will take a bit since I'm only averaging around 26-27 now. 

But honestly, it's been incredible. I get on the bike, put some music on, and I've got 2-3 hours of literal peace. It's like meditation, thoughts come up, but just flow by. And I've felt more ""healing"" in the past 3 weeks than I have in the last 6 months of trying to deal with shit in my life. 

Just wanted to share. I've never cycled before (except commuting, since I live in the Netherlands), and despise running. This has been such an unexpected addition to my life.",cycling,2021-04-24 13:02:36

1670514485.0,"After working in a bike shop, I understand where the condescending attitude of many shop employees come from.","What's happening in bike shops (and speciality retail of all types) is the workers are low paid and have to watch wealthier people with more disposable income come in and buy bicycles that often are equivalent to what they'd have to save over a year for. 

That's the first part of the reason, second part is, people tend to come into bike shops when they're having a problem. Nobody is really happy to have to deal with a mechanical failure. A lot of the customers coming in the shop are in bad moods. This is why at comic shops it's often still a fun happy atmosphere because this second part of the dynamic isn't there. 

When I began work at the shop, I went in with the idea that I was going to provide the best customer service I could and not be the type of unfriendly, condescending person that I'd encountered a lot when I went into shops. At first I was, but then the daily grind of it began to take it's toll. For example, having to kneel down and show a guy in a business suit how the presta valves work on the 5k bicycle he just bought while  he acts likes he's better than me the whole time. Then one customer referred to a derailleur as a ""pulley thing"" and then got irritable when I couldn't fix his bike fast enough. 

Which brings me to the third part of the dynamic..the customers coming in the shop (who have to spend their time on other professions) are necessarily more ignorant about bicycles than the mechanics who work on bicycles all day. This gives mechanics an easy and obvious way to regain their self esteem by making fun of the customers about their ignorance and being condescending in return. At first I tried to resist this and keep in mind that the majority of customers were good, but the bad customers were really bad, and as the months wore on it became psychologically easier to make fun of all the customers and see it as an us vs them thing. I knew I was becoming the type of condescending douche shop employee I had once hated, but I didn't care. It really did make it a lot easier to come to work everyday and fit in with the other mechanics to make fun of the customers, and we made each other laugh a lot doing it. 

Also, many guys like to come into shops to just talk because they're passionate about bikes and here in the US,  where I live at least, cycling isn't that popular as it is in Europe so it can be sometimes hard to find other cyclists. The fact remains though, that a bike shop isn't a cycling club, no more than you'd go into a auto shop and expect to have conversations about Nascar. It actually takes a lot of focus to work on a bike and noise is distracting (I didn't even like to have a TV on) so if you're going into shops wanting to chat and getting the cold shoulder that's why, because the guys are trying to do something that takes a lot of concentration. 

Hope this explains things for everybody. Also, I highly recommend building at least a modest home workshop and trying to do your repairs yourself. Even if you're not mechanically experienced, if you ride bikes you should try to start thinking of yourself as a mechanic too. It's a mechanical hobby, and actually having an organized workshop with the right tools is 80% of it  Just like it's much easier to cook a good meal when you have a well stocked kitchen with nice appliances.

1694530713.0,Just walked 5mi in road shoes,"It's crazy how no one really gives a shit about strangers any more.  I'm a bit older, 53, and when I was young (when we walked uphill both ways through 100' snow drifts to school) if you were walking a bike putting your thumb out you'd get someone to pull over pretty quickly.  Not anymore.  

Punctured my tubeless and it didn't seal (not convinced on tubeless for road but that's a different conversation) so I put a tube in but the CO2 canister turned out to be a dud.  Never had that happen before, actually.  It got maybe 2psi into the tube and that was it.  Not enough to keep the rim off the road even for a slow roll back.  Everyone I knew was out of town or not available, taxi and uber would not pick me up with a bike, so it was a 15mi walk home in cleats.  I've walked on hot asphalt in socks before and it was a week of raw feet so wasn't doing that again.  

I put my thumb out for every truck or SUV that looked capable of carrying a bike without too much trouble that went by and probably 75 of them went by without so much as a glance in my direction.  They were probably were deliberately not looking at me, of course, you don't want to actually look at the person asking for assistance because then you might actually feel something.  

I get why, for example, a woman alone might not want to stop but the vast majority of vehicles I put my thumb out for were driven by men, and mostly working class men by the appearance of the trucks, who should have had few worries in that department.  

Anyway, after an hour or so of walking an old farmer, with an even older dog, stopped and offered a lift.  As he said, ""we've all been there and needed a hand.""  It's sad how many people don't think like that any more.  I learned quite a bit about his family on the way home and he seemed like a genuine, decent human being.  Very much appreciate that there are still people like that in the world.  

He asked me to pass on the good deed and I will.

1654810791.0,Road Bikes really do make a monstrous difference,"I've been a pretty active cyclist for a little over 2 years and against the advice of my cycling buddies I always clung to my Hybrid/Mountain bike.  Despite this, I often rode with them on longer rides of 60+ miles. On these rides they often averaged 15-17 mph and although I could keep up, I could tell they were outputting far less effort than I was. On solo rides, I often did 13-15 mph as a solid effort with anything 15+ to be pretty fast. A week ago, a cable broke on my hybrid bike and I finally decided to make an upgrade and fork over some cash for an actual road bike. 

I purchased a Giant Contend AR3 a few days ago and just took it out for my first long ride and was absolutely blown away. The drop bars, the efficiency, and the areo positions were an absolute shock to my system. Initially I started slow around 14-15 mph and was absolutely gliding with my friends. After mile 45 I told them I wanted to see the true potential of the bike and began to push to mile 60 at around 80% effort. Between miles 47-60 I was absolutely flying solo with a light crosswind at 24-26 mph, a speed which was completely incomprehensible on my old bike. 

I am still blown away at just how fast these things are. Every record I worked so hard for to accomplish on my old Hybrid bike is about to be shattered.

I was out doing some mixed surface, gravel, and easier MTB today.  Wearing baggies, five tens, definitely not aero.  I was on my way home, waiting at a red light and a roadie in full kit, narrow slicks pulls up behind me.  

I say hello and he doesn't acknowledge me.  Okay, some people can't be bothered with niceties, whatever.  There was a thread a few days ago about that topic and a bunch of posters were fine with ignoring other cyclists.  Different strokes.    

We take off and I fully expected to be passed quickly.  I'm not pushing the pace or anything--and nothing.  I glance over my shoulder and there he is, drafting me.  We come up to the next light and I said ""You're gonna draft me and not even say 'on your wheel?  You know that's dangerous, right?""

Then he turned at the light and took a different route, to ride against the endless wind, alone with his shame.  

Or something like that.  

I don't care if you're introverted or in your own head or trying to count to one hundred million.  You probably shouldn't draft complete strangers because that can be seen as aggressive or uncomfortable depending on the person being drafted, but if you're going to do that--you need to communicate that you're there.  

If I need to maneuver or stop sharply and I don't know you're there?  I'm gonna do whatever I need to do without regard for you and we're probably going to crash together.  That will suck.

Details: I look up and see the greenlight ahead of me about 50 feet. I check the crosswalk counter...plenty of time 15+ seconds. I proceed thru the intersection (5 lane) at a good speed.

Suddenly, my Spidey-sense tingles and I ninja a truck about to T-bone me at about 30 mph. Only my cat-like reflexes save me as I grab brakes and perform a life-saving stop. Mid slide my Jedi mind slows time to evaluate the scene. Did I run a red light? Nope. I check and my light is green. I even check his light which is red. Still in Jedi time slowing mode I check the driver who is frantically trying to stop. I also calculate my stopping distance and his death machine trajectory and determine I'll stop in time...maybe a foot to spare combined with his much needed swerve away. So then I switch to what insults I will hurl. 

Well fuck me. That's what it felt like. 

If I had not seen that motion to my left and stopped, I'd be dead. Dead dead. 

Happens that fast. 

Yes, I always check intersections and I checked this time, too.

1605214027.0,Broke the 40 mile barrier today,"I started cycling back in May on a Momentum iNeed Street I ordered from Giant through a local bike shop. I was overweight (still am) and terribly out of shape (not so much now) and in several different types of chronic pain.

My first ride was 2 miles and it nearly killed me. I kept at it though because I had come to the realization that at the age of 63 I either had to start taking weight off and getting fit or I would soon not be able to. I work in healthcare so I see plenty of examples of where that leads.

Two miles became 5, then 8, then 12, and so on. I rode every day that I had some time and the weather permitted. I slipped and went down in water and broke my helmet and got a nasty concussion. Still I kept at it and little by little, it started getting easier.

I was losing weight too but not just from cycling. I started eating better and gave up alcohol too. My back pain and sciatica got better and then went away. The rides started to be fun, even in the brutal summer heat of Houston.

Then I got a road bike. I should have done that at the beginning but had convinced myself that my back couldn't take that riding position. It can. My average speed went up a bit though it still isn't fast enough for group rides. My outings got longer and longer. Two days ago I did 34 miles and as soon as I got home I regretted that I didn't turn left instead of right and make it 40.  

Today I did 41.4. The wind was against me 2/3 of the way but I broke 40 miles. An early goal I had set was to do 50 miles before the end of the year and that is now within reach. Also I have lost 45 pounds along the way and feel better than I have in years.

I want to thank the good people in this sub for all of the information and encouragement I have found here. This has been a valuable resource for me and, I'm sure, many others and all of your contributions are appreciated by us newbies. Thank you all.

I got him a seat on my bike at 12 months and put him on a balance bike at 18 months, and at some point I had him riding a trike so he could get used to the pedals.  He was a little older than 2 1/2 when he made the jump to the pedal bike.  I had to run behind him with a hand on the seat for a couple of weeks, and then for a few days he would ride on his own while I told him I was holding the seat.  Now he regularly rides 2 - 3 miles at a time.  The next step is for him to be able to start and stop by himself.  

My wife says I take too much pride in his bike riding, and that may be true.  But the thing that makes me most happy is how much he likes riding.  No matter what else is going on or what kind of mood he is in, he is always ready for a ride.

1623811596.0,Scared into Cycling," I’m 32, a hermit, sat in front of my computer for the past decade or better, my only form of exercise being waddling to the bathroom, my bed, or the microwave. About a month ago I went to step up one single step and my leg suddenly felt weak, almost collapsed out from under me. That terrified me. So, because I’d rather not end up in a wheelchair by the time I’m 40, I ordered a cheap walmart bike online and hoped for the best.

I’m trying. I’ve gone out riding every day for the past two weeks.

But there’s a reason I chose to take up cycling over any other form of exercise. All those vlogs on youtube about people biking across an entire country with nothing but their bike and a few supplies? Wow. I realized there are places I want to see before I die, and relying on other people to get me there isn’t an option. I’ve never learned to drive a car, and have no plans to. But I want to see the ocean again. I want to visit a renaissance faire. I want to get to attend at least one comic convention in my life time. But all of these things are over 100 miles away, the ocean over 200.

And here I am, two weeks in, still feeling like I’m dying on my measly quarter mile up a 4% gradient hill route. I read online all the time, people saying how anyone can do three miles. So I tried that. There’s a three mile loop around the block back to my house. I ended up having to push my bike most of the way, because there are no flat areas around here, it’s either uphill or downhill. I made it home, yes, but only because my only options were “make it home” or “curl up on the side of the road and die”. No cell service in the boonies, and I didn’t own a water bottle yet, so I paid for my idiocy with heat exhaustion for the next two days. Lovely.

It’s ten miles into town. That’ll be my first big goal, the smaller one before that will be to conquer the three mile loop that tried to kill me. But I just feel like I’m not making any progress, so these goals seem like impossible pipe dreams, and a 200 mile trip to the ocean? Forget about it. I know it’s only been two weeks, and I know I’m starting from level 0 when most start at level 1. And I can navigate steps with no trouble now, so I know my efforts haven’t been for nothing. But isn’t that hill supposed to be getting easier? The only thing I feel has strengthened is my stubbornness and willingness to push past pain. I don’t let myself stop near the top for a break anymore, I make it to the top, but it hasn’t gotten physically easier, I’m just more stubborn.

Am I maybe doing something wrong here? Am I wasting my time? Will this method not get me to where I want to be? My bike is a seven speed. I believe it said 21 speed on the box, but it’s got seven cogs in the back, so I’m calling it a seven speed. I’ve had the front on the smallest “granny gear” since I bought it and haven’t touched it. If I wanna shift, I use the back ones. I’ve kept the back cog at 3, which is a pretty darn easy gear and leaves me spinning out pretty much everywhere else, yet I can still barely make it up a hill that’s barely a hill. I’m still learning when and why to shift. The seat is fitted to the correct height. I have a comfortable seat. Pretty sure the bike isn’t the problem.

Any wise words from seasoned cyclists? Or heck, even from people who are struggling just as bad. Should I keep doing what I’m doing until it’s easier, then move on to a harder challenge? Or am I doomed to stagnate if I don’t do something different? 

( Side note, I did get a checkup from my doctor semi-recently. Aside from being a little overweight, he gave me a clean bill of health. So I'm not worried too much about that. Yes, losing weight would help, but I'm not quite ready to give up sugar just yet. One step at a time eh? )",cycling,2021-06-16 02:46:36

1596291821.0,"After 8 years off the bike, I rode 575 miles in July and have crushed my weight loss goals!","50/M loved biking when I was young.  Had a road bike and regularly rode 30-50 mile rides several times a week.  When I got older, I got into mountain biking, and had lots of fun with that.

15 years ago I got a sedentary job that took up more of my time.  Along with marriage and offspring, my times to ride got less and less, and my weight and overall health went south.

10 years ago, with a good scare from my doctor, I dove back into cycling.  Picked up an older Trek, and started racking up miles.  Got a handle on my eating, and really started to turn my health back around.

8 years ago, I hung it all back up again.  There is a scrap yard near here, along a route I usually rode.  I often saw old pickup trucks loaded to the gills with scrap metal, old washing machines/stoves, etc. pulling in there to make a little money.  So it was no surprise one morning to hear a truck struggling behind me heading towards the yard.  

The truck passed too close - less than the 3 feet provisioned by state law.  Irritating, but not unexpected.  What was unexpected was the trailer he was pulling: it had a load of metal on it, part of which was an old chainlink fence.  The fencing had partially rolled off the trailer and was dragging the ground alongside the trailer.  The fencing whipped past me, gouging into my leg, and nearly snagging my bike.  I went down.

Thinking about that incident kept me off my bike.  I did start going to a gym, riding the recumbent for aerobic exercise and was a regular in spin class, but these analogues aren't nearly as enjoyable as an actual ride on a real bike.  My weight loss stalled and eventually started to reverse.

Once the pandemic started, my gym closed.  I took my bike back out, replaced the worn and dryrotted parts, and have been riding every day for the last three months.  Such a difference!  I look forward to riding, rather than begrudgingly attending spin class.  Excess pounds are just falling off me, and I feel like I can climb for hours.

Over a thousand miles in the last three months, and over 30 pounds down!

No more worries about rickety loads of scrap metal passing me anymore - the scrap yard closed down a couple years ago for EPA violations.

1591665458.0,Today I took KOM on my street and I feel like I just won the tour de France,"I know, I know.  Strava merit doesn't really mean anything in the real world and some people take segments to dangerous levels.  That isn't really the case here.  I have a half mile flat strip in my neighborhood.  No speed hump/bumps and the speed limit is 25 mph.  It is a four lane wide street that runs in front of my home.  It gets quite a bit of cycling traffic as this road is part of a much larger cycling trail through Tulsa.  A year ago when I first started cycling on a cheap-o Walmart bike I created this segment in Strava thinking I was hot stuff.  I was then immediately put in my place when I was 128th.  Talk about a reality check.  I since bought a used hybrid bike (Giant Escape 1) nothing special but much better than the old Walmart bike.  The bike has a touring rack on the front, plastic flat pedals, and fresh new tires.  Nothing special, no upgrades, and entry level components.  I have put more than a thousand miles on this hybrid now.  It has been almost a year since I first created this segment. I tried to pick the best possible line and gasping like a locomotive while chanting ""shut up legs"" in my head, I gave it my all. This morning I took KOM at 24.2 mph on a used hybrid and 11 seconds faster than the previous holder.  The previous holder was on a racing bike (2017 EM525).  To be fair the previous holder was on a long bike ride that day and probably wasn't really trying to set any records.  So if you're reading this user Kindler // Eliel Factory Team please give me at least a day or two to bask in this insane glory before you show up and smoke the record with some ridiculous number under a minute.

1621706006.0,I always carry an extra tube for passers-by. Today it came in handy!,"TLDR: If you see someone who you think MIGHT be in trouble, don't be afraid to ask!


Ever since I first raced the Chicago Triathlon (and witnessed what the summer heat does to over-inflated tires) I started carrying an extra spare tube and CO2 cartridge with me. I passed so many people that day with flats that I wish I could have helped. It's been a few years since then, but the extra tube that I started carrying finally came in handy for someone. 

I was only 10 miles into my 40-mile training ride  today when I saw an older gentleman, maybe late 60s, walking his bike. As I always do when I see someone in that situation, I shouted ""Are you good? Need any help?"" Sure enough he responded ""Flat and I'm 10 miles from home!"" I pulled over and checked the size of his tires to make sure my spare would work.

He said he didn't know how to change it so I asked him for permission to touch his bike and got started. He was super inquisitive as I was doing it so it actually became a bit of a lesson, not just how to change the flat but that he should probably be carrying a kit with a spare. Only took a couple minutes and I took a second to adjust his rear brakes which were a bit out of whack. He didn't have any storage on his bike so I offered to take his bad tube with me, tied around my bars. He said ""thank you"" repeatedly, called me ""The Good Samaritan,"" and was on his way.

I'm not sure if I made his day or if he made mine! I'm just glad I had that extra tube.",cycling,2021-05-22 17:53:26
1598476775.0,Adding insult to insult,"So in the spirit of commiserating with fellow cyclists...

I set out today for an early 30 mile ride, after being off the bike a bit lately due to work and family.  Tough ride, a little rusty, pretty slow on the climbs -- but that's the price of taking time off.  Nonetheless, it was beautiful, the air was crisp and clean, and there was even a hint of fall around.

Until I started climbing the big hill, went to downshift, and... whoops, cable is no longer connected to the shifter.  Alright.  I've done that repair before -- bit of a pain in the butt because you have to take off the bar tape, and unwrapping and re-wrapping the bars on the side of the road is some battlefield mechanics to be sure.  But totally doable, and not that time-consuming.

I pull back the rubber cover, and... right then what must have been either an Andean Condor or a damned flying Ostrich or something flew right over my head, and dropped just the biggest bird poop I have ever seen, right onto my helmet and shoulder.  I mean, that bird must have gained ten feet of elevation after dropping that load.  It was awful.

So there I was, helmet and jersey off, pale upper body exposed to the world, bar tape unwrapped, by the side of the road -- doing a complete re-wrap and then a water-bottle-washup.  Two other cyclists passed, and just about lost it laughing -- I must have looked like an absolute nutter squirting and scrubbing my jersey on the side of the road.

I love cycling.",cycling,2020-08-26 21:19:35

I kept riding my normal pace and I could see he was working hard to catch up (that's what I'm telling myself anyway).  When he finally caught up, he clung to my wheel and I pulled him along for the next 15Km.  I've posted before curious to know what other riders think about while riding, but at the moment this guy caught up to me, my first and only thought for the next while was, ""alright, LET'S GO!!!!"".

Some people might be mad that a total stranger would do this, but in fact, I was honored that someone of a higher caliber than me (since he caught up), felt I was keeping a good enough pace to draft me for such a long time.  I'm sure he could have passed, and I don't care that he didn't.

When we got to our fork in the road, he thanked me for the pull and we had a quick exchange of ""where ya headed and have a great ride"".  This is one of the reasons I ride, what a great community!

1591621459.0,Can we be less demanding of pedestrians?,"Had an interesting experience yesterday. Couple of us friends decided to walk on a path that we usually bike. Its a mixed use path. This is the first time I had a pedestrian perspective into cyclists on a mixed use path that we usually bike. As we were walking, we were on the right hand side of the road and majority of cyclists would say ""on your left"" and we would move and they pass. There was this one cyclist that was so angry that we are not walking in a single line and was yelling at us. 

Walking is often a social activity for families or friends - they will usually not walk in a single line, which makes conversations hard. Kids etc are often with the walkers and they may zig zag on the path

Which brings me to my point, we cyclists do not get to demand that pedestrians get off the path or walk one at a time or in a line. We cyclists should not treat mixed use paths as a race circuit. If we want to race, we need to goto a velodrome or go into less populated bike routes.

I guess some of us cyclists behave on mixed use paths like car drivers behave on roads. I will be more respectful of pedestrians on my next ride.  Just wanted to share this, since we all take so much crap from car drivers, I wonder what pedestrians think of us.",cycling,2020-06-08 13:04:19

I cannot afford a really nice bike at the moment (it still cost me $600 without add ons). Any time I try to discuss an issue about my bike they immediately blame my equipment and dismiss the concerns I have. Is this just normal bike shop attitude because I don’t have a “good enough” bike? It’s really discouraging and it makes me avoid going into the shops.


Update: Thank you everyone for your advice, support, and shared experiences. It’s sad to hear that this is common in many LBS, especially for women. I’m taking your advice of completing more simple repairs myself as well as trying to find a new LBS that is open to helping all levels of cyclists.

1600851421.0,I did it y'all.,"I've been binge eating food that is less than healthy ever since my boyfriend decided to break things off with me, that was over a year ago. Before that I was really happy with my weight at around 130lbs, now I'm 167lbs which for my height (5'4/162cm) isn't great.

Yesterday I finally found the motivation to get my old road bike out of the storage room and bought some bib lycra shorts and a jersey for comforts sake, I rode about 2 miles yesterday in all, quick cycle to the store here, quick cycle to a friend's place there, you get the idea. It was great, I finally found an exercise that I enjoyed.

Today I cycled 5 miles, I chose a route to a local coffee store, it had a few longer, smaller hills and a pretty short but steep hill, I'll admit I stopped 3 times in all because I felt like my legs were going to give out on the steep hill but I did it, didn't walk, just took a minute breather.

Not to sure what the point of this post is but I just needed to talk about it.

1627181680.0,My grandfather died cycling and I want to take on his pursuit for cyclist safety,"It only happened just this morning in Central Florida but I got a call from my mom to find out my grandfather had been killed while out cycling. I guess I am kinda glad to say he truly died doing what he loved.

He was as passionate as a pure distance, easy pace 77 year-old former marathoner could be. He just recently had been very proud of his 1500+ day streak of biking at least 5 miles. He was biking on a busy road (45mph speed limit according to an article and some Florida redditors) this morning as he has done many times before. A teenage driver hit him off of his bike and into traffic where he was run over by a semi and potentially one or two other vehicles. 

I come here not just because I know this subreddit may understand the pain I’m feeling after reading yesterday’s post about a redditor’s brother being killed by a driver. I come here asking for help and direction. My grandfather was a passionate advocate for cyclist safety in Central Florida and led many attempts to get more cyclist-friendly infrastructure built against a vocal suburban Florida. I want to honor that legacy in some way but I honestly don’t even where to begin but this felt like as good of a place as any.

To echo yesterday’s sentiment: thank you for reading, bike safely, and tell your loved ones you love them. 

I miss him already so much and I can only imagine him laughing at the cruel humor of how he died and flipping off the driver from beyond.

Edit: As many have mentioned, a separate article I hadn’t seen mentions the actual road was McCullough Rd not I-95 as I’d seen in a different article.",cycling,2021-07-25 02:54:40
1672458119.0,It's not much but I reached my goal of 1000 miles.,"I don't really make these posts much because what I do is nothing compared to what most of you do. 

But I'm a middle-aged fat dad who's trying to turn into a middle-aged fit dad, and after a bike ride with my best friend in May, I've turned a lot of shit around and I'm pretty proud of this, so I'm hoping to inspire people who've been where I am to keep going. 

Ever since I was 13, I've been anywhere from overweight to severely obese (people think ""morbidly obese"" is the end stage, but you'd be surprised how little extra weight it takes to get categorized as ""morbidly""; severely is the gold medal here).

So when I was out in California visiting my best friend, who's been into cycling for years, he lent me his e-bike and took me on a nice ride on a fire road near Malibu. 

When I got home, I decided I could make some changes and got myself a bike. 

At the end of November, I looked at my Strava stats and see I'd done about 700 miles since I got my bike, so I set a goal: do an average of ten miles a day in December, and end the year with 1000 miles under your ass. 

Yesterday, I was down to needing just over ten to hit that goal. My son was riding with me and said let's do 20. 

We did 22. Well, I did. He bonked at 18 because he hadn't ridden more than 6 since summer ended, and he's only 14. So I had to pedal my ass off at the end to get back to the car and pick him up. 

But in the end, in my first year of doing any kind of regular exercise, I did over 1000 miles on a bike in just over 6 months.

I was on a harder effort today, a ~17 mile loop I use when I only have a short amount of time to get in a ride.

Shortly ahead of me, a car pulled up to a stop sign on a side street.  Maybe 250-300 feet?  He looked at directly at me, to his right.  He then looked to his left, where there was no oncoming traffic.  He then pulled out right in front of me, where I would have T-boned him in the B-pillar if I didn't perform an emergency, skidding stop.  

Realistically, I assume he did see me and just didn't realize the speed I was traveling, but still--a driver looked right at me and then pulled out right in front of me.

Wanted to share this for others who may be on a similar journey, or have a story like mine. I never thought I would be where I am now when I first started with that E-bike. What a difference a year makes.

The driver leaned over and yelled at me for being on the road. As he was yelling a SUV pulled up behind him and went to pass him. Mid sentence, the driver realized he was being passed and floored it, and cut off the SUV. The SUV then pulled him behind him and laid on his horn. At this point, the only logical thing for the Mercedes to do was to slam on his brakes and completely stop. The SUV then tried to pass them again, and the SUV was again cut off by the Mercedes. The Mercedes promptly slammed on his brakes again. This happened three times before the Mercedes finally gunned it and sped off.

1653304196.0,Is It To Much To Ask That People Announce Themselves When They Want To Draft On Me?,"I need a little sanity check here, because there’s been something driving me absolutely bananas the last few months. For context, I am a young(ish) (mid 20s) female rider.

I usually ride with a group. Sometimes as we’re riding we’ll pick up the occasional solo rider who rides with us for a bit, drafts in the group, and makes some light chit chat before heading their separate way. Totally cool.

Recently, I’ve been riding on my own a lot more. I live in an area well known for road biking and so there’s a solid chance you’ll run across another cyclist on your ride. Usually they’re headed in the opposite direction and we give the obligatory head nod. However, I’ve recently been noticing that random riders (always men) will come up behind me and start drafting right off my back wheel, insanely close with no warning, hello, or “hey is this cool”. They’ll draft off me for 5-10 miles of back country roads saying literally nothing and never offering to pull while my heart rate is going 200 bpm, not only because I’m pulling the whole time, but also because I’m pretty sure there’s a 50/50 shot I end up on an episode of Dateline with Keith Morrison narrating my untimely death. Hence forcing me to bike as fast as humanly possible to see if I can drop them.

Eventually, we’ll hit a traffic light or a stop sign. If I’m feeling exceptionally spooked, I will usually pull out my phone and pretend to make a call and they’ll keep going on their own. Otherwise, I just keep riding and hope they turn another direction or sometimes I end up dropping them and they just fall back. For some reason it really freaks me out that I’m riding with a random person I’ve never met before in a sparsely populated area with limited cell reception.

I’ve told some of my male friends about this and they told me I need to be more friendly. But I wanted to come here to see if I’m being completely unreasonable.

I had stupidly forgotten to bring a mask (I bike in a ruralish area where no one is around, so I usually just keep one in my saddle bag for emergencies... except for today apparently), so I was hesitant to call an Uber. And I was wearing clipless shoes, so walking home wasn’t a pleasant option. 

I picked up biking about four years ago, and I had changed exactly four tires to this point. Two in a class with an instructor and two from the comfort of my garage with a YouTube how-to video to guide me. All four times, it was pretty difficult.

But, in the blazing sun, beset my mosquitos and trucks whizzing past me, I managed to fix my flat and get home safe.

Today I went for a 30 mile ride on a bike path nearby and on the way back with probably 4 miles left I blew a tube... Since I’m new I really had no tools/supplies to fix it so was resigned to just walking it back to the car. Within a minute of stopping a couple stopped to see if I had everything I needed. They went through their stuff and only had a patch kit and a tube that was way to big. I said it’s fine and continued my walk. The next guy who stopped to check on me, had all the goods I needed. Asked if I could change it, I told him I didn’t even know how to get the back wheel off let alone change it. No worries he says, and walked me through the whole process. So thankful he helped, offered him some cash for the tube he wouldn’t take it.  Then to top it off as I’m riding back the couple that couldn’t help me earlier had swung back on the road adjacent to the path and was fully ready to give me a lift back to the car, smiles and all.

1659822371.0,I just don’t like group rides - fight me.,"OK, I’m just being a bit provocative to get a conversation started…. That said, I’m honestly amazed at the number of cyclists who evangelize group rides. I just don’t get it.  Convince me I’m wrong.  The way I seen it:

1. Scenery - most of my rides are between 30-50 miles and, whenever possible, through beautiful areas (I live in the city, so it takes me 5-8 miles to get out).  Riding solo, I’m able to take in all the scenery and am not staring at someone’s arse and back wheel 90% of the time.  
2. Pace - Yes, it’s nice to go faster, but my principal goals for a ride are to get a good workout and an escape.  Why should I feel better about averaging 20-22 mph with a group vs. 17-18 mph on my own?  Who are the numbers for anyway?  It’s also been a challenge finding friends who ride the same pace as I do (yes, I’m conscious larger, organized group rides have different pace groups - see #’s 1, 3, 4,and 5).
3. Coordination and planning - it’s hard enough to find 2, 3 or 4 hour windows to get out for a ride on my own - adding in the complexities of other peoples’ calendars just makes it harder (I’m not retired and have kids).
4. Safety - I’m just not sure there is really safety in numbers.  I’ve been on group rides with people who insist on riding 2 or 3 wide on roads, forcing cars to just wait it out or to gun it to get around.  This drives me nuts - it literally creates road rage in drivers.  And, in my opinion, creates that 1-2% of drivers who seem intent on almost killing cyclists on purpose.  I’m also still anxious riding in groups, despite picking up cycling 5 years ago and averaging 4,000-5,000 miles/year.
5. Social - I ususally find it challenging to carry on a real conversation on group rides - until we make a cafe or coffee stop.  My wife will ask me “how is ____?”  I’ll admit that I don’t know, despite riding with him/her for the past 3 hours…. Perhaps just grabbing a drink would be better.

1616773822.0,I messed up my dudes and dudettes,"So I was doing some errands today, picking up some stuff at the shops and enjoying the short bursts of cycling in between shops. So as a somewhat responsible cyclist I employ some forward thinking like coming up to a island division on the road, it's best to own the road to stop car drivers doing the old close pass. This also includes having some awareness of not being to close to a curb.

So I was minding my own business, returning home when a driver behind starts beeping at me, happens every now and then where a driver gets impatient, but generally they don't beep they rev and get close, but this was different they were persistent and really going at it. I got scared and angry coming up to the island division on the road so I realized this person would try to overtake so I decided to own the road they were right up my ass and the horn was constantly going. I flipped them off and waved my hand being like wtf is wrong with you. 

After the Island I tried to pick up speed to get away, then they drove along side me a prolonged close pass and indicated to turn in on top of me. I thought they were trying to kill me. I picked up more speed to get away and I managed to on a saucy 10 year old banger of a bike. Meanwhile they were going at the horn like an animal. They did another prolonged close pass and again indicated to take me out yet another squeezy bum moment, or so I thought. They rolled down their window and screamed at me 'you dropped your wallet'. 

Well feck me pink, I didn't even get to say sorry or thank you. I can understand why but damn I wish I got the chance I feel so bad about my reaction. At the same time it was eye opening they went out of their way to help me a stranger who was an arsehole to them. I guess it's time for me to have a look at myself to be kinder on the road. I'm not from an area that hates cyclists but I have been hit by a car and close passed so many times which is why I can be quick to anger or being scared but I've never experienced such kindness on the road before. I think it's time for me to stop watching urban cycling videos where people get angry this probably doesn't help with my attitude toward drivers on the road.

Be careful out there everyone but hopefully you got a bit of a smile from my mess up and some faith in humanity is restored.

1616724746.0,Happiest when I'm cycling. Depressed when I'm not.,"Does anyone else feel the happiest you can be when you are cycling? Even when I am having the worst day of my life, once I get on my bike and ride all the stress washes away. I feel so free and complete. I feel wholly myself when I'm riding.

A few days ago I did a 35 mile ride through Queens. It was a beautiful ride and I was happy the entire time, even when I got lost. The next day I was so depressed. I could barely get out of bed in the morning, and not because I was sore, but because I was depressed.

If I could ride 12 hours a day, every day, I would. I love it so much and it sometimes feels like nothing else can be better than cycling.

If I had to give up sex or cycling... man that would be a tough choice.

UPDATE: I just want to drop a note of thanks to everyone who responded with such kind, sweet, and caring comments and private messages. I didn't expect such a response. I was really trying to talk about how much I love cycling. I've been doing it regularly for 15 years and it's been a constant in my life. But the post opened up something about my level of unhappiness the past couple years.

I appreciate all of the advice. Frankly, I'm surprised how so many people casually recommended SSRI medication considering potential side effects and how they should be recommended by a professional. However, I know the intention was to help so I appreciate the words of support. I know medication works for a lot of people.

Thanks again to my great cycling community!",cycling,2021-03-26 02:12:26
1612187939.0,Having a bike stolen is emotionally brutal,"This is probably just a stream of consciousness but just wanted to chat with people about it. Posted yesterday about my trek Domane al 2 being nicked from my house and asked for tips on recovery (this Reddit is great and there were some really helpful and nice replies). Having sat up all night it dawned on me that my bike is probably long gone and it’s a horrible feeling. I’m not sure what the difference is between a bike and other property, maybe it’s the amount of time you spend with it, but it feels much more personal than having, for example, a phone stolen. 

If anyone knows a way to get over it, please send help. Maybe I just need to grab a new bike, but I doubt it will feel the same.

Edit: The response to this has been really helpful. So many comments which have reassured me that I'm not alone. It might sound utterly stupid but for a couple of hours yesterday I convinced myself that I was the only person in the world who had had been wronged in such a way. As I said, this was stupid, but it's just how my brain was working at the time. It's nice that we can all share in sad stories but carry on cycling afterwards.

1601504402.0,We have lost two cyclists in Nairobi in two weeks,"The first fatal accident was due to a reckless PSV and it was in the news a lot since the cyclist was well known and was a budding racer [https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/sports/2020/09/18/kenyan-cyclist-dies-in-hit-and-run-accident-petition-signed-to-cs-macharia/](https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/sports/2020/09/18/kenyan-cyclist-dies-in-hit-and-run-accident-petition-signed-to-cs-macharia/)

The second case happened last week at a junction where the cyclist, a dentist, lost balance and an oncoming lorry crushed his head. It is speculated he could not unclip in time when he heard the lorry.

The sad thing is that I was with the first cyclist the previous day before he died and I had sold a bicycle computer to the latter last month. The first one was just 22 and the latter has left behind a wife and a young family.

1694272318.0,C'mon guys do better. Things like this make all of us look bad.,"So, this morning, my friend and I went out early (sunrise) for a ride on our local MUT. Not even a mile in, a C group of about 10-12 is coming towards us. We dropped single file and make sure we are well to the right. They are two and three abreast. One of the three abreast almost hit my riding partner head on. None had lights and they acted like they owned the entire space. 

About 6/7 miles further down, a larger (probably b group this time based on their speed) group forced a runner on the edge of the MUT in to the muck on the side of the trail. They actually veered toward the female runner to deliberately scare the person. I slowed and asked her if she was okay because she looked a little shook up by the encounter.

1598202161.0,A note from a runner who just started cycling,"So I’ve been distancing running and cross training at the gym for a few years and consider myself to be in excellent shape. This year I moved to California and when COVID happened I thought I would try something new, so I looked into road biking. I did some research and ended up buying a used Specialized Allez from Craigslist. I took it on my first “long” ride this week, a 13 mile loop that I have run enough times that I knew it by memory. There’s a hill on this loop that I absolutely dread, but I figured if I can run up it, how much harder could cycling be?

Way. Way. WAY fucking harder. Holy shit. I literally thought I was going to have to stop and walk my bike up the hill a few times. It took every last bit out of me to get to the top of that hill. 

But when I got to the top without quitting, I felt amazing. I can’t wait to ride more today!

1601761900.0,"Max distance before today was 35 miles. Just completed my first century, and 52 minutes under my goal - 6:08","Work and grad school aside, I just failed at meeting my training goals over the last few months. Ended up riding once a week, maxing out at 35 miles.
Last night I decided to hit the century this morning, go as far as I could and just take it for what it is.

Sea Gull Century, it was virtual this year but I live on the route so I just did a 25mile loop 4 times to hit my target.
Got up this morning, went to the grocery store and stocked up on cliff bars and Gatorade.
Hit the road at 9am. Told myself I’d be happy with any result, but the ultimate goal was 100 miles under 7 hours.

The last 5 miles weren’t pretty, I was in a bad place! My calves were cramping so bad when I looked down my muscles were twitching like an alien was under my skin... but I pushed through and rolled across the ‘finish’ in 6:08 total time. Nothing for the leaderboards but I’m damn pleased with myself!

For fuel, quartered each cliff bar and ate a nugget every 15 minutes for the entire ride - so 6 bars in total lol. I also had two bananas and half a pb&amp;j sandwich during the planned rest stops at home to refill bottles and hit the bathroom.

SHOCKED how much I drank! Two 26oz bottles on the bike, refilled 4 times each. 208oz over 6 hours! That was surprising to me, and never straight water. Either a mix of Gatorade and water 50/50 or a power electrolyte mix. Usually one of each per lap.

I think the weather helped tremendously, light wind under 10mph all day, high of 65F, and for those not familiar with the ride - FLAT!
The only issue is really wind, which was light today (still a few gusts across the recently harvested corn fields, but manageable).

The best part, since it was a solo ride and quite polar opposite to previous years SGC event environment, my wife and a couple close friends figured out where I would hit 100 miles and set up a few streamers to cross the finish line! They had a cooler full of water, Gatorade and a nitro milk stout waiting for me...
Pretty accurate too, I was 100.06 miles at the line!

I am not gonna lie, I doubted myself. And when I crossed 62.2 I almost called for a pickup, claiming my metric achievement ... I was cramping up already, my shoulders hurt, my butt hurt, I was done. But, at that point I figured I’d see how much of it was mental and pushed forward for another ~38 miles, and I’m glad I did!

Thanks to those who gave me encouragement, and to those who doubted me - fair enough. But here’s the proof:

I was riding on the shoulder and then I decided to merge onto the road to make a left turn. I look back and I see a car maybe 500 meters away which was plenty of time for the car to notice and slow down. The car didnt slow down and instead started to honk the horn for me to get off the way and when I didnt, he decided to get on the shoulder and pass me anyways, leaving maybe an inch of separation between us and I almost lost balance. The intersection was on a red light at the moment so he couldnt keep going. I saw him and went to his windshield and starting knocking on it because I wanted to tell the guy that that was wrong and that he could have killed me. I was already expecting some sort of aggressive response from the driver but he looked at me as if he was seeing a ghost, like he couldnt believe I actually went to him to confront him and he got kind of scared and rode away, even went through the red light to avoid the confrontation.

This is a bad idea, and I knew it. So before yelling or pounding on the window I took a breath. I waved to get the guys attention and he opened the door. I explained what happened and how passing that close could scare someone off their bike and creates real danger. He said he saw me and “wasn’t going to hit me”, I just asked that he give the next cyclist more room. He agreed. We shook hands. 

I have had some near altercations in the past where drivers were reckless deliberately and when you catch up to them (which seems to happen often) it’s a yelling match and frankly unsafe. I’m certain all of those interactions did nothing to create more safety for cyclists. 

This one might have actually helped though. By just putting a little kindness out there first, just not leading with the intense anger I get when I’m scared I’ll be hit and never see my family again.

I loved that bike to death and would take it on 5-10 mile rides, (long for me at the time) but last fall it broke. I also haven't exercised at all in winter, except for a few hikes on the nice days.

I went to the doctor for my yearly checkup in February this year and I'm 6'3 and 300lbs. No way that that little Trek could hold me anymore (it's about the size of a medium frame) so I sold my drone and bought a slightly used XL frame mountain bike for $700.  I loved that drone, but I wanted to fix my weight problem.  It took me a while to find it, but with modern components and geometry, I knew it was the right one. That thing climbs hills like a monster.

Today is the day after purchasing my new bike. I went on a bike ride that I intended to be only a few miles, but I went 18 miles (not bad for my first ride in 3 months) and have never felt so alive.

1591630824.0,A message from your moderators regarding the BLM protests and this subreddit,"Hello users of /r/cycling,

We the mod team want to first acknowledge the amazing protests that are being led by black, indigenous, and people of color who are doing far harder work than we will ever have to do moderating a subreddit. Protestors do not deserve the treatment they are getting, peaceful protests do not work when the cops are the ones starting the violence. Black lives matter.

We are a largely white moderating team. What does that mean? That we are all still learning to be anti-racist but hopefully these steps will get us even a tiny bit closer to a world where protests like the ones that are happening will not need to.

What does that mean for this subreddit? 

We have always tried to moderate through the lens of anti-racism but we are not perfect and still have work to do. 

For right now it means that any posts that have to do with the protests will be moderated using a similar criteria to the Bad Faith Participation rule that [r/BlackPeopleTwitter](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/) uses: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/wiki/bfp](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/wiki/bfp) and you will not get a warning before being banned. Those posts are also not the place for your jokes.

We will still be banning for racism in any comment/post.  


>""But bikes have nothing to do with politics/racism/systemic violence/etc.”

The ability to ignore politics is a privilege and ignoring politics is ignoring suffering. You have always been able to see yourself represented as a “cyclist” in media/advertising/racing. You do not have to think about what neighbourhood you might be riding through. You do not have to double check that your bell works incase you get stopped. You do not worry about someone thinking you stole the bike you’re on. Your neighbourhood has bike lanes. We can’t even begin to list all of the ways that riding a bike intersects with politics/racism/systemic violence/etc.

Biking while black is a real thing.

1618160412.0,Guide to Buying your Next Bike,"Hi all, I am an owner of a certified pre-owned bicycle online shop based in Michigan who specialized in aluminum-carbon repair and paint.

I have been in this business for the better part of the last decade and want to give some hints/tips to purchase your next bike during the Covid-19 crisis especially with the influx of new people wanting to join our community

Cross-posted to multiple forums to help educate more people.

\*\*Sub-$500 Bikes:\*\*These are one of the hardest bikes to find right now because everyone is getting into the sport of cycling. With the new market pushing their dates back to 2021, used is usually the way to go.

\-Determine what you want to use your bike for: MTB trails, roads, or city/pathways. If you want to use your bike for mountain bike trails, obviously a mountain bike is the best tool for you. Similarly, road bikes are best suited for roads, and cruiser/hybrid bikes are best for limestone trails or city loops. *Now here's the tricky part, if you want to do 30% mtb trails, 60% pathways, and 10% roads - mountain bikes are the most versatile for that. Rule of thumb for versatility is mountain bike > hybrid > road*

\-Know your size. If you have no idea what size you are, here's three tricks that can help determine that.

1. Visit your local bike shop (LBS) and determine which size fits you best for YOUR riding style. Do not let them push you to one size because that is what they have in stock.
2. If you cannot visit your LBS, ask your friends of similar size to loan you their bike for a day. Cruise around and see if its your size. Repay them in beer.
3. Last case scenario is look at sizing charts online. Most reputable bike companies have generic sizing guides for their models. Use that for your advantage. If you are in between sizes, 99% of the time, you want to size **DOWN**.

\-Stay towards reputable companies and stay away from Walmart specials\* or sponsored bikes like: Hummer, BMW, Whiteclaw, etc. (These tend to be Walmart bikes with Logos thrown on).\*\*\*\*\*Schwinn Axum is an excellent entry level bike that I will touch on later.

1. Best companies for cheaper bikes are: Giant, Specialized, Trek, Cannondale, Marin, Diamondback\*\*, Raleigh, Kona, Felt, Jamis, Fuji, Scott, GT\*\*, Norco to name a few\*\*\*\*\*\*These bikes can also be sold at big box stores like Dicks. They are still good bikes, but can be poorly assembled.
2. For UK brands, best companies are: Merida, Cube, Sensa, Lapierre, Focus, Bulls, Rose, van Ryssel/Triban/Rockrider, and Triban/Decathlon (Thanks for the additional information u/godutchnow & u/TacticalCornflake)
3. Try to stay away from Mongoose, Schwinn, Huffy, Roadmaster, Hyper, etc.

\-When comparing two bikes, groupsets with the highest level of rear cogs are *typically* best.Shimano's hierarchy for entry components follows: Tourney, Altus (M2000), Acera (M3000), Alivio (M3100), Deore (M4100-6100).  Shimano Tourney is a 7-speed, Altus/Acera are 8-speed, while Alivio is 9-speed, and Deore is 10-12 speed.Sram's hierarchy for entry components follows: X5, X7, X9, NX. Sram X5 starts at a 9-speed and is comparable to Shimano Alivio.

\-Aluminum is your best friend in this category. Aluminum frames are lighter and better than their steel counterparts, and will not rust. You won't find carbon fiber bikes or titanium bikes in this price range.

\-Newer is USUALLY better. Components from a 2018 mid-entry bike is miles ahead of 2007 high-end components. With that said, if you are looking at a 2015 mid-level bike, or a 2017 entry-level bike at the same price, the 2015 mid-level bike will be a better buy.

\-Google, Facebook Marketplace, Bicyclebluebook, and Ebay are your friend for price checking. Bicylebluebook is on the low end of prices now, but is still a good tool to look in the price range and tells you the MSRP of the bike. Does not include upgrade prices, nor boutique brands.Ebay SOLD values as well as Google will show you what similar bikes have sold for. Facebook Marketplace will show you what other, similar bikes are selling for (Go for 500 miles to tell you the most accuracy).

\-If buying a mountain bike for trails, please buy disc brakes - either mechanical or hydraulic. Rim brakes/cantilever brakes work terribly in more extreme conditions such as mud, dirt or rain.

\-27.5"" or 29"" wheels are better than 26""\*\*\*. You can find more parts available including rims, tyres, tubes, etc.**\*\*\*** Downhill bikes are excluded from this

\-Stay away from bikes who have been garage queens for 10+ years. That usually means that the bike sat and will need new tyres, tubes, tune-up, and greasing.

\-When buying hybrid or mountain bikes with suspension forks, actively look for forks with a manual lock-out lever on the top of the stanchion. This allows the fork to act as a rigid fork during usage on pavement or trails where suspension is not typically needed.

\-Bargaining in person and with knowledge is the best way for people to drop prices. If you Facebook message a person, throwing out a low number for their bike, chances are, they will not accept or even answer you. However, if you meet them in person and counter with an offer with knowledge why you want the lower price, they tend to accept a lower price. Do not try and haggle the seller down more in person if you have agreed upon a price.

&#x200B;

**Sub-$1000 Bikes**

These are pretty hard to find a good bike for under $1000 because the sub-$500 bikes seemed to have been marked up to this price range.

If you are new to cycling, this would be your best option to find a bike for you. All rules in the Sub-$500 category will fit for this too.

\-Avoid 3x front derailleur systems for all bike including hybrids, roads, and mountain bikes. 3x systems are ancient and will take a lot of fiddling to get the system to work properly.For the best results and simplicity, go towards 2x (double) front derailleur systems for road and hybrid bikes while 1x/2x (Single or narrow-wide and double) derailleur systems for mountain bikes.1x or narrow-wide systems for mountain bikes remove the front derailleur from the groupset and uses a larger-range cassette in the back to compensate.

\-Stick to 10/11 speed rear derailleurs for road and hybrid bikes while mountain stick to 2-10 speed or 1-11/12 speed groupsets. For 10 speed rear derailleurs for mountain bikes, make sure that it is a clutch system i.e. Shimano Shadow plus

\-Stick to 2015+ hardtails for mountain bikes in this category. You will start to see full suspensions in this price range, but will be older than 2013 with outdated geometries, components, and rim sizes.

\-Stick to 2013+ for aluminum road bikes or 2009+ for carbon fiber road bikes. Giant Bicyles switched from their tubular carbon to injection molding carbon near this time which greatly improved the stiffness and strength. Other companies followed suit around this time as well

\-Aluminum frames with carbon fiber forks for road / some hybrids are still your best bet. You will start finding some carbon fiber frames and even titanium frames in the category, but they tend to be older.

Modern aluminum frames are stiffer and lighter than the carbon frames from the past. They tend to take a beating more, and are more readily available to the public.

\-Disc brakes are a must for this category for both mountain and hybrids. Hybrids\*\*\*\* can do fine with mechanical disc brakes, but you should find hydraulic disc brakes for mountain bikes.\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Hybrids do not need disc brakes, but for this price range, it's the best bang for the buck.

\-For mountain bikes, solo-air forks tend to be much better than coil forks for this price point. Air forks have more adjustability and tend to be better for low and high end compression.

\-Bikes from [Bikesdirect.com](https://Bikesdirect.com), [Bikesonline.com](https://Bikesonline.com), or [Bikeisland.com](https://Bikeisland.com) are a good buy! Bikes direct and affiliate Bike island sell direct to customer and their prices are pretty competitive. Motobecane and Gravity are their two top names and have similar geometry to the big brands without the price tag.

&#x200B;

**Sub-$2000 Bikes:**

Now you are getting into the mid-range level bikes that tend to have the most modern components and geometries.

If you are brand new to cycling, you do not need to spend this type level of money to get a bike to fit your needs. Most of the time, you won't be able to tell the difference.

Don't spend more than a $1000 for a hybrid bike. Carbon fiber hybrids such as the Specialized Sirrus Carbon is not needed for anything. Period.

\-Determine the type of riding that you enjoy:

**Road bikes:** Gravel, race/crit/aero , TT/Triathlon, or endurance/touring bikes.Gravel bikes can be broken into cyclocross bikes or gravel bikes perfect for gravel roads, two-tracks, etc. Cyclocross bikes have wider clearance in the fork and rear triangle for bigger tyres, but have a geometry similar to a racing bike. They will feel more cramped if you use it for gravel biking.  

1. Gravel bikes are similar to cyclocross bikes in which they have wider clearance in the rear triangle and fork for bigger tyres. They also have a more ""relaxed"" geometry similar to hybrid bikes or endurance bikes. Meaning, you sit more upright than racing bikes. Gravel bikes tend to be the *best* option for all around biking because they can easily do gravel & fire-roads, XC type single-tracks, and pavement with different tyre options.
2. Race/Crit bikes are great for just that. They're fast, stiff, and twitchy, which is great for racing, but not the best for long rides by yourself. These bikes tend to have a shorter stack (more aero) and a longer reach meaning that you're more into the drops for aerodynamics .Aero bikes have a similar fit, but have elongated tubing to be more aero-dynamic.
3. Triathlon/Time-trail bikes (TT) should only be used in triathlons or time-trials. Never go on group rides because they are notorious for poor braking and handling.
4. Endurance road bikes are perfect for longer, more leisurely rides or just long days in the saddle. They're geometry is more similar to a gravel bike than a Race/Crit bike, and are not the best for sprinting/cornering.

**Mountain Bikes**: Cross-Country (XC), Trail, All mountain/Enduro, Downhill

1. XC mountain bikes (Full-suspension or hardtails) are geared more towards fire roads to technical singletracks with suspension of 80mm-120mm and 29"" wheels. They're great for very technical trails with root sections or rock gardens. They are not really meant for jumps or leaving the ground much.
2. Trail bikes are more beefed up Full-suspension XC bikes with more front and rear suspension (120-150mm-ish) with shortened chainstays and lengthened toptubes. They're great for long climbs and bombing down mountains.
3. Enduro mountain bikes are between trail bikes and downhill bikes with beefier suspension, slacker headtube angles, and longer wheelbases. These bikes excel at descents and drops down mountains.
4. Downhill bikes are meant to only go.... downhill. These are the bikes that you see on Redbull commercials with dual-crown forks and can basically descend down any mountain. Many places have lift stations to bring you up the mountain, just so you can bomb down it.

\-*USED CARBON IS OKAY*. Modern carbon frames can take a huge beating and do not fail as catastrophically as they used to. Don't believe me? Pinkbike did a study comparing two frames back in 2017 with great results. Ensure to look over the frame properly like any used bike. Look near the joints for stress cracking, or spider-web cracking from impacts. Carbon makes a dull thump when failed compared to a hollow knock when structurally intact. Best way is to use a coin and knock on the area in question and surrounding areas.

\-2015+ is recommended for any bike that you choose. 2013/2014 was a huge change in geometry for mountain bike pivot systems and geometry. Road bike categories grew more defined during this period with the addition of gravel bikes, and endurance bikes.

\-Stay Shimano 105+ or Sram Rival+ for any road bike. With this price range you should get 11 speed for bikes.

\-If you choose to go hydraulc on road bikes, go with the Shimano/Sram HRD shifter and not the cable actuated gimmicks such as the Giant Conduct or TRP HY/RD. These never work as well as intended.

\-For mountain bikes, get 12 speed and dropper post (not needed for some XC trails) for this price range. Sram introduced the 12-speed system in 2012, and readily became available to the public around 2015. This eliminated the use of the front derailleur and gave you a massive 50t in the back for any climbing

\-For mountain bikes, try and bike a ""Boost"" frame meaning 12x148mm spacing in the rear and 15x110 in the front. This will give you a better range of aftermarket rims to buy and is more modern than the old 12x142 and 100x15 spacing.

&#x200B;

\**The Schwinn Axum came out in November 2020 to directly compete against the Giant Talon, Specialized Rockhopper, and Trek Marlin.It came in two versions: Standard: $398 or Dropper Post: $499 with modern geometry, tapered headtube, 1x groupset, and 29x2.6"" tyres.The Axum competes surprisingly well against those bikes and is perfect for entry level mountain biking. HOWEVER, Walmart employees still assemble the bike and do not torque down any bolts.When I bought mine for testing, it came with a loose headset, poor tuned shifting, and rubbing rear brake. I highly recommend you taking this to your LBS for inspection prior to riding the bike.*

I then showed him another link (I’m quick with the phone lol) clearly stating that our state law clearly states that drivers coming out of driveways must yield to all traffic coming from ANY direction, so it’s their job to wait for the overtaking car to move back after passing the cyclist.

1595001584.0,Was attacked by a dog a couple of months ago. The legal stuff just settled.,"My event is below, but if this happens to you, here is what you should do (based on what I learned).   This also applies to car accident (assuming you live). 

1.  If you see blood.  Call 911.  You absolutely need a police report.  Even the cops told me that if it was a scratch, to call them.  

2.  Do not confront the owners.  

3.  Take pictures.  I took pics of my leg right after. Before and after blood started flowing.  Wasn't thinking about documenting anything.  I was just sending pics to my wife.  These pics were extremely important in legal case.  

4.  I declined ambulance due to cost, but wish I would have at least taken them up on medical treatment.  I opted to ride 10-miles back to my car.   This didn't really hurt me in the court case but could have.  I took pic back at my car and my leg was worse.  That made it difficult for them to argue that I was okay enough to ride.  

5.  Go to doctor.  Get treatment and antibiotics.  Even on antibiotics my bite became infected.  It was not a fun week after the incident.  

6.  Call an attorney.  I called an auto law attorney.  They knew exactly what to do. 

7.  Do not post anything to social media until everything is settled.  

8.  Get your settlement and buy cool stuff for your bike.   Takes a couple months but insurance companies do not fuck around with dog attacks.  They ask how much.  The $$$ is nice, but it was a brutal couple of weeks.  I had two full punctures and some small puncture wounds.  I will have permanent scars on my leg.  

Here is what happened:

I was on a gravel road ride.  Black lab came out of no where at light speed and chomped on my left leg, just below the knee.  Took me off my bike.  I managed to kick myself free and the dog ran away.  I never saw the owners but I heard the owner calling the dog.  I dropped a few f-bombs in their direction.  Even if I had anti-dog spray (which I carry now), I would not have enough time to spray.  The dog was that fast.  NEVER UNDER ESTIMATE HOW FAST THIS CAN HAPPEN. 

Bike was okay.  My leg looked fine so I walked about 50-yeards and then looked at leg again and it was all blood.  Then the pain hit.  It was unbearable.  So I called 911.  They had to ping my phone because gravel roads don't really have road signs.  They found me and called an ambulance, which I declined because I've read too many stories about the cost of ambulance rides.  I have good insurance but the first few thousand are out of my pocket.  I figured I could ride the 10-miles back to my car, which I did.  IN hindsight, I should have taken medical care.  I may not need a ride but they could have patched me up good.  I was a mess at my car.  I went straight to ER.  

Dog was quarantined for two weeks.  Thankfully it was current on all shots.

I know it's not a huge distance to a lot of people but it wasn't long ago that 5 miles seemed out of reach to me, so a huge achievement for me personally :)

1666535300.0,First big crash as a cyclist,"Last Tuesday I decided to go for a quick spin after a very busy and stressing day at work. It was supposed to be a short 30km ride trough the hills and back home for a shower and spend some family time.
I finished the first climb on the route I planned, started the descent, and then the first thing I remember is to be in a ER, with a doctor stitching what was left of my right index finger. I don't have any recollection of what happened before, during or hours after the crash. The only eye witness was the car driver behind me, who called ""911"" (it's 112 in my country). According to what he saw I lost control of the bike at around 60Km/h, hit the curb e then smashed against a concrete post on the side of the road. As a result of the crash e fractured my C7 vertebra (luckily without causing permanent nerve damage), my right collarbone in two spots, I've had spots of subdural bleeding in the brain, a broken and teared apart finger, as well as several bruises all over the body. My helmet was beyond destroyed (cracked in halve, surely saving my live). My bike...well, my bike is actually fine! (as far as I can see by the photos my wife took) The handle bars are completely broken and twisted, my right shifter is beyond repair, but everything else looks ""decent"". Tomorrow I will have surgery to repair my collarbone and my index finger (probably will be partly amputated). 
I'm aware of how extremely lucky I am. A crash like this can be life threatening. 
I don't know how this event will change me and the ones close to me. Time will tell...
Anyway, I just needed to take this of my chest.

1625229578.0,Cycling saved my life,"I have told this story before-- on this sub, but I thought I would share it again. I will try to keep a bit brief(er).

My story begins about 4-years ago. I had two young kids, a wife, and overall, a pretty decent life-- so I thought. I have always had battles with depression and anxiety, but it has never been so bad that I haven't been able to work or not be able to function. Well, life seemed pretty good all things considered.

That said, I didn't quite realize that I had given up almost any self-care in order to care for my kids and wife-- I let my physical health get out of control (much easier to do if you stop paying close attention). Of course, I thought, I was heavy, but I relied on my belief that I used to be an athlete and so (naively) I still had a good baseline. In addition, my wife and I had been arguing-- a lot. Kids, work, etc... who knows? But we were arguing a lot. Fortunately, she was going to visit her family for two weeks while I worked (I teach summer school), so we could get a small break. During her time in Florida we argued over the phone-- but nothing seemed worse than normal.

And then she said it-- she told me that she was going to extend her stay with her family and that she did not know when she would be coming back. A few days later, she told me that she didn't think it would be a good idea for her to come back, that things were too volatile with us, and ultimately, it was time for a separation. A separation? I couldn't believe it-- of course we argued, and of course things were difficult, but a separation?

Just like that I was all by myself: no kids, no wife, and afraid and embarressed to tell my friends what was going on. I put myself together for a few days to keep teaching and keep up the facade, but by that Friday, things set in. In an argument with my parents on the phone, I told them that this was it, that there wasn't much to live for anymore. (I promise I will get to the cycling part). I got in my car, drove to the nearest train tracks, and just waited. I guess my parents had called the local police, and while they did not know my location, one officer did have my number. He called me (twice, because the first time I hit ignore), and just listened. We talked for maybe 20 minutes-- I guess I was so taken in that I only half realized the trainw as going by. He gave me his personal phone number, made me promise I would call him if I ever needed to talk, and aske dme to call him when I got him.

Fast forward a few months and my wife and I have started working things out. I still struggled with my anxiety but at least my relationship was getting better. We decided to go for a date night/bike ride at a hotel in the next city over since my parents were coming and we had babysitters. The next morning, during breakfast, I noticed a voicemail from my doctor's office. It told me that I needed to call: asap. I called, and they informed me that my cholestoral was ""critically high"" (foreign nurse who claims she later said ""clinically"" but either way, I heard it as ""critically""). It scared the crap out of me-- so much so, that I had a near nervous breakdown.

That was it, I thought. Enough of living for everybody else: I am going to get myself back into shape, take some time for me, and get my heath back. I started cycling a bit-- 5-10 miles a few times a week. Then, I found this subreddit and started learning about different types of bikes and decided to look into a road bike. What a stroke of luck: someone on facebook was selling a Specialized Roubaix in my size! The price was right and the biek was perfect. (As though it couldn't get any better-- when he found out that my wife works with students who have autism, he took a bunch of money off since he said his grandson has autism).

That bike changed my life. Whether it was on the trainer or out on the road, I could not get enough. I did my first charity ""race"" (ride but I like to call it a race!). 47 miles! I never though I could do something so challening. Well, that was just the start. I then trained, rode, worked out, and did a 75-mile charity ride/race.

And here I am now: preparing for my first century ride. I had a setback with covid since I was prepared for the ride and then it got cancelled last year, and I put on a little bit of weight. I have gotten most of it off-- and am still working on getting rid of the rest-- but I feel great and am as inspired and excited as I was when I started.

This subreddit has been an inspiration-- as silly as it sounds, I look at pictures, of century rides, of stories, and am continually inspired (and, I'll admit: a bit jealous about some of the places you guys ride). But mainly, you all are a community that is truly special.

I wish everybody wonderful riding-- whether you are new or experienced-- and continual enjoyment of one of the best forms of self-care.

And please feel free to comment (or DM me) any tips for my upcoming century ride!",cycling,2021-07-02 12:39:38

Get a 2000 lumen ore more headlight, and a rechargeable rearlight avoid the battery powered ones that can't be recharge. On both my ebike and roadbike I use to commute lights primarily a head light has saved my tail more times than I can count. Run your headlight in the day at a lower setting and run max brightness at night and a rear light. I run a literal motorcycle angel eye headlight on my ebike. I am actually considering getting a second light for redundancy on the ebike. Also keep the lights steady. A steady light you can gauge distance on. I myself have had problems with flashing lights can't tell if you are right on someone or if they are far away makes turning, over taking difficult and takes away from road focus since road obstacles also use flashing lights.

Edit for the love of god angle your lights down.

Edit my lumen numbers may be off all my lights are from amazon. But I figured on the automative grade stuff the lumens aren't wrong.

Another edit because I forgot to mention how helpful handle bar extenders can be. I have handle bar extenders on both bikes making the lights sit at a level to where they properly illuminate the road. The handle bar extender mounts the lights 5 or so inches lower than regular handle bar level which makes a huge difference.",cycling,2020-05-26 10:41:20

I was about half a mile from the turnaround point of my out-and-back and I started thinking about my options. Despite Komoot saying I’d have a bike lane on this stretch, I had a wide shoulder on my side of the road, but a narrow to non-existent shoulder on the return side.

As I crested a hill, I looked down toward my destination, at maybe the 200th car passeing me far above the speed limit, at the lack of safe riding space on the return side, and I decided the risk wasn’t worth the reward. I walked back to cell signal and called my wife to play bike taxi. Only got about 10 miles of a 22-mile route.

[Gloversville NY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloversville,_New_York) got it's name from its industry - and that was making gloves. Fast forward 100 years and leather gloves are no longer the pinnacle of men's and women's fashion... hell they don't even make the list. As fashion moved on, so did the jobs and the bustling economy. 

&#x200B;

I tell this story to set the stage - American towns forgotten for one reason or another that had once been major economic hubs.

A few weeks ago I was up in Gloversville and one night I happened to pull up Zillow. Now, I live in Washington DC and when I learned that the average for sale price of a 2,000 sqft home in Gloversville was $150,000... I had a thought. 

&#x200B;

Could a dedicated and deliberate urban planning movement in some of America's forgotten cities -  replacing downtown car-centric infrastructure with parks, byways, bike paths, local business - be enough to encourage young people to consider these communities for the long haul?

Would a bike only city be interesting enough for you to pick up and move your life? Can we retrofit dying cities with a way of life that a vocal minority are searching for in the USA?

Wow this is cool. Unfortunately hard to enforce and there’s been very little advertisement within Massachusetts. 

There would also need to be campaigns to educate drivers on the new law, most people are clueless and think that bikes belong on sidewalks.

The law mandates that cars must provide at least a 4-foot buffer when passing a “vulnerable road user” which includes cyclists.  It also allows drivers to cross the centerline, even a double-yellow line, when it is safe to do so.  If it is not safe, drivers must remain behind a bicyclist if there is not sufficient lane width to provide the 4-foot buffer.

1589460385.0,Advice for when cycling is straining your marriage,"Hi Cycling Enthusiasts -  I \[F/32\], and been in a relationship with my husband \[M/32\] for just under eight years now. When we first met, he owned two bicycles (one road, one hardtail) and enjoyed riding on a nice weekend.  Fast forward to now: he owns 6 bikes currently (I really had to pressure him to sell two of them because we just didn't have space in our 1k sq ft apt.) He rides (either mountain or road) every single day that it doesn't rain.

Here is a typical workday for us: After work (4pm), he comes home, changes into gear, takes a bike and says ""see ya'"" and goes off riding out the front door and will come home sometime between 7pm-8pm usually, but as late as 9pm sometimes.

Here is a typical weekend for us: He loads up a bike in his car to go somewhere to ride with his buddies or to ride somewhere further away and he's gone for an entire day OR for the entire weekend.

Here is how a rainy day is spent: he needs to fix/change/adjust/rotate or otherwise do something on a bike. His work stand is permanently set up in our living room (which also serves as my office during COVID). There are tools, parts, pieces, bits, and just general bike stuff in every single room of our apartment.

Here is how his money is spent: Drops nearly $2500 on a new bike just last month, doesn't even discuss it with me, just does it.  Dropped $3500 on a full suspension mountain bike 3 years ago (same story, doesn't discuss it with me just does it). I overheard him with his buddy on the phone a few weeks back that he's looking at a new $5500 bike this year. I told him we can't afford that, and when was he going to discuss it with me? Long story short, he was never going to tell me, he was just going to do it, and deal with the ""fallout"" later.

This isn't even an activity we can do together.  I do like to ride too (I have a road bike and a mtn bike), but not the way he rides.  I have a bad heart (medically) and I have a very clearly defined upper limit on just how much power I can put out.  He will complain that he is having to noodle along at 14mph (he prefers the 16-18mph ""casual"" and 20-25mph ""working"" pace) meanwhile my heart is going at 185bpm and I am struggling just to breathe.  I can do 20 mile rides, but that really is my distance limit (he does lots of 65+ miles routes) and only when I can keep the pace slow enough that (hills aside) my heart rate stays below 165 bpm (as advised by my doctor).

**TL;DR: Here is the problem:** I am not part of the discussion of any of these activities.  I am ""told"" what he is going do, I am not asked/consulted/or otherwise involved in any way. I feel secondary to his hobby in every way. I have told him that I feel this way, and he tells me that it's not true, that I just don't understand his hobby, that exercise is good for you, so why am I so against it, etc. etc.

For those avid cyclists out there, is this just the way it is, and I just don't understand what it means to be an avid cyclist?  Or is there some way I can get him to understand that while hobbies are good, exercise is great, I don't like that his entire life is biking and that I don't feel like we have enough quality time together because of it.

**Lunchtime Update:** Wow - thank you all so much for your comments!  Seriously, you people are amazing!

I wanted to add a few details that a lot of people asked for.  I am an inner-city high school science teacher, so I am employed but I do not make a ton of money.  My husband is an engineer who makes 3x my salary, but even together, we don't break into six figures. He's been furloughed for 4 weeks due to COVID, so we have been living off of ""our"" savings and my salary.  We have a ""his account"", ""her account"" and ""our account"" and 50% of both of our take-home pay is *supposed* to go into ""our"" account for rent/savings/bills etc. Right now, I am putting in close to 90% of my salary into ""our"" account and he is putting about 25%, which is why I get so upset when he drops so much money on bikes when he isn't putting into our joint account what he agreed to.  I have tried to discuss it with him, but I get stonewalled a lot. 

I'm hearing many of you saying that it's deeper than cycling, and we should go to relationship counseling - been there, tried it.  He said no - adamantly and repeatedly. :/ 

Do other parts of our relationship work?  Sure - we are in agreement about a timeline for a house, future kids, etc. We enjoy cooking dinner together (which we only seem to do together on weekends now, and that's if he is not away on a bike trip). We enjoy going for walks/hikes together, but since he's been biking so much, I'm lucky to go on a walk a week with him (otherwise I go alone). I do actually enjoy biking (I'm even a bike commuter!) but as I said, I can't keep up with him so although we both like this activity, it's not something we can do together.  I liked all the suggestions about an e-bike, but we just can't afford it this year.


**Post Dinner Ride Update:** I went on my own ride tonight (I usually try to ride 2-3 nights a week on my own anyway.

1593424204.0,I‘m a newbie and scared of what people think of me,"This is my first Reddit post ever, so please bear with me. 

So I basically started cycling 2 weeks ago when I bought a cheap one. It doesn’t have klick pedals, but it works and I finally figured out the basic handling of it. In the town where I live there’s many riders and I usually see plenty of them when riding. My overall fitness is a catastrophe, and I can’t go for rides longer than 25 kilometres as of now. I’m scared of what people think of me as a newbie, without a good bike or decent clothing, and I wonder if anyone out there experienced these feelings, too and might have a suggestion on how to change my mindset on this matter. 
I started cycling because my therapist recommended it for both physical and mental health reasons, and I really like it. And I appreciate this community very much! 
Stay safe out there.


Edit: Wow. 
I don’t know what to say really, this thing kinda blew up. 
Thank you all so so much, your inspiring, motivating, encouraging and incredibly friendly comments and answers made me the happiest I’ve been in months. Apart from my relationship with my girlfriend, this might be the best thing that happened to me this year so far. I’ve just come back from a ride (25 km again) after I spend the day at university. 
Last time I checked, this post had like 7 comments this morning and now we’re in the hundreds. I guess it will take me a couple of days to read through all of them. 
If this is just a glimpse of how this whole cycling-community-thing is like, then I’m pretty certain that I’ve found a treasure of a community right here. Thanks again, your advice and views and opinions are very much appreciated, you guys are nothing less than awesome. Lots of love from Germany, stay safe out there, and see you on the road!

Everything started fine, but 25 minutes in, some asshole in a lifted truck with a Florida plate (I live in New York) and a Trump 2020 sticker rolled coal on me. 

5 minutes later, I made a wrong turn an ended up lost in a neighborhood I've never been in before. I decided to stop and get my bearings, but as I was getting off my bike, my shorts got caught, causing me to slip and smash my balls with the front end of the saddle. After a few minutes of suffering, I got back up and decided to set off again, but while half clipped in, I put too much pressure on my already sensitive left nut, causing me to wobble, overcorrect, and fall over before I could completely unclip. I'm sure the guy mowing his lawn two houses down enjoyed the show though. 

I finally made it home, only to find that some asshole threw a bag of trash out of his car into my front yard, where it exploded and went everywhere. Overall, not what you'd call a great ride.",cycling,2020-09-12 21:52:22

1595881726.0,"Don’t be me, and go biking on unmarked trails with no cell service in 106F heat index.","Today I had off of work and thought it would be fun to explore a state park/wildlife refuge near me. There is one main trail that leads to a lake, and then north of that there is a series of gravel trails that I’ve never been on. I decided to explore one of the more northern gravel trails with the intention of trying to make a loop from the trails to the lake, back along the main trail and then the road to my car. Things did not work as intended. 

The trail I picked started fine for a few miles and then was full of mud from the night before. I decided to walk the bike through the mud... but then the mud became knee deep and I was thoroughly in deep shit. I persevered and got past the mud. With my cleats and disc brakes and tires covered in grime, I had trouble riding on the relatively brush-laden path so I kept walking the bike. 

At this point I came to a crossroads: you can turn right and take a series of relatively established trails to the main trail, or you can turn around and wade back through shit, or you can continue on through an unmarked section of trail that seems like it’s just a shorter distance to the lake. I said “fuck it, I’m already here” and started sloughing through the unmarked trail. 

But it was really unmarked and not cared for. If you imagine a carpet of branches and thorny vines for 4 miles, that’s what it was. The park service had run a bulldozer through here but it was literally a blanket of branches to step over and around. We’re also approaching mid day and it’s a high of 97F with a heat index near 106F. So I probably should’ve just taken the more established side trails or sucked it up and turned around. But at the time the unmarked trail seemed better. 

Until it wasn’t. I was carrying the bike and finding myself gassed. The thorns kept wrapping around the tires, groupset, and slashing my legs. I was making really slow progress and, while I could see my progress on the trail on GPS, I was really dismayed to know I had a while to go before I was at the lake. Oh, and there’s mosquitos m everywhere so stopping for a rest is more painful than continuing. 

Ultimately I ditched my bike. I had to for my own safety. I was getting hot and had less than half my water left. I started becoming concerned for my own ability to survive, considering I’m on an unmarked trail and there is not shit for cell service. I can’t get a hold of the park service. I even tried 911 (with the intention of informing the park service) and it wouldn’t go through. 

But ditching the bike was beneficial and I eventually stumbled out to the lake. I called the park service and said that I’ve got a bike abandoned out on this trail, and of course they scolded me. I get it. They said they might not be able to get it with an ATV. 

So after walking back almost 5 miles on the main trail in full sun with no water left, I was fortunate to have someone hitchhike me to my car and drove home. Tomorrow I come back
with a ton of water, better shoes and thorough mosquito repellent to go extract my bike before we have a week of rain. I can use the side trails to more easily cut through to the bike and then hopefully ride out. 

It’s better to be lucky than good and I easily could’ve been lost out on the trail in the middle of a huge park. There are bears and poisonous snakes noted within the park. I was most afraid of twisting my ankle on the branches and being truly immobile without service. It was definitely eye opening but I know better now, and so should you. 

Going to get my bike back tomorrow with a friend. Wish me luck!

EDIT: Got the bike back today after a grueling trek through one to the park service’s recommended side trails which ended up being full of debris. So I slogged it through the mud (again submerging my legs and almost having my shoes swallowed) and then rode back the very first trail from day one where my friend picked me up.

I explained to them why we do it, and that we do it for our own safety so that a motorist doesn't attempt to pass when its unsafe and nearly hit us, but they were just not taking it. To them, a cyclist should have to get off the road if they see a car coming since if they're in a car they're not slowing down for someone on a bike. I tried to explain right-of-way, and that since the cyclist is in front of you they, therefore, have the right of way but their counter-argument was that we don't pay taxes (false, many of us also drive cars), and that we don't own the road, which I agree with *but* that means nobody, not even cars, own the road.

How do you explain to people like this why it's safest for a cyclist to take up the majority of a lane, not allowing a motorist to pass until it's safe?

1568162523.0,My bike got stolen nearly 6 years ago and I found it today.,"I received a Saracen Vice full sus MTB for my fourteenth birthday (2006). It was considered fairly affordable then and even more so now. Despite being a full suspension mountain bike it was low end with v-brakes and a visible coil over the rear shock.

I loved that bike and that bike made me fall in love with cycling. I named the bike Marvin Lee because it was my silver and black battering ram (a bastardisation of lyrics from Meat Loaf - Bat out of Hell ""Silver Black-Phantom Bike""). Despite being a full sus which weighed approximately five Imperial shit tonnes I rode it from London to Paris at age 18 because that's the only bike I had.

At 21 I still had that same bike until it got stolen from my house in Derbyshire (UK). Despite the theft allowing me to upgrade to a significantly better bike I was fairly upset at the loss of my bike and accepted I would never see it again...

Until tonight. Almost 6 years and one city later (only 20 miles from where the bike was stolen) I saw a Saracen Vice locked up in the city centre. I took my time and checked it out but I knew the moment I saw it. That was my bike. Marvin Lee. 

The mismatched wheels after one was stolen in 2013, the very mismatched tyres have yet to be replaced (one Schwalbe city slick and one knobbly), the none original front quick release skewer, the frame dents, the scratches in the seat post, and the bracket mount for the same lock which was cut when the bike got stolen where all there. I did enough damage and minor modifications to that bike that I absolutely know that it was the same bike which was stolen all those years ago.

With very little evidence to legally prove that was my bike (knowing and proving are not necessarily the same) and a gig to attend I left the bike locked as the current owner has left it. I am sure that the thief likely sold it on and it may have been sold multiple times before I found it tonight.

I am very happy that the bike has been looked after and is still being ridden. Whoever it is that owns my bike now, I hope you are enjoying b it and I am glad you are looking after it: though you should probably replace the tyres as the rear one is pretty buggered. Everything else is looking pretty damn healthy so please keep enjoying Marvin. Also, whoever you are, buy a better lock before you suffer the same as I when you find your bike stolen.",cycling,2019-09-11 00:42:03

In recent years I’ve started getting in to cycling and probably go out 2 or 3 times a week. My wife on the other hand sits at home in front of tv, has gained a lot of weight to the point its nearly becoming a mobility issue, and just accuses me of abandoning her any time I arrange anything (due largely to her lack of a social circle and lack of effort in trying to develop one). Anything more than an hour of cycling is referred to as being excessive.

She never really proactively arranges anything, but as soon as I mention anything like a bike trip she blows up about how it takes up all our time that should be together.

It has come to the point that she gets upset about it every other night, while I’m also dipping out of cycling trips I really want to do so as to try to not upset her. A bit of a no win situation.

It feels pathetic that something like cycling could be the catalyst to ending a 15 year relationship (6 of which married), but it seems to be rapidly heading in that direction.

It pains that me that she is so upset about it but at the same time I feel that life is too short not to be able to pursue basic hobbies because of her limitations and lifestyle choices.

I don’t know if he’ll improve or try to learn, but we’re not riding together anymore. At least we had the conversation.—

&#x200B;

My riding partner for the past year is M/60, I think he’s averaging about 50 miles a week. We met at a large group ride. He wants to up his average and asked about a year ago if he could ride with me on my longer days. I said yes. He rides with me about once a week. But this is his only ride on most weeks.

We ride often on a very nice and popular bike trail. He insists on riding side by side. He rides on the inside and doesn’t keep his line. On corners I will either back off or push ahead as he often comes too close for comfort. He often gets yelled at by on coming riders. I’ve asked him to ride single file, but he likes to chat. I feel like if I continue to ride with this guy, he’s going to cause us to crash. We’ve had close calls.

Last straw happened. We were on an organized ride, narrow rural roads, and he was riding next to me, chatting away. And I asked him to ride single file as I heard shouts of “Car back”. Instead of dropping in line, he pulled in closer next to me. I braked to let him get ahead of me and this surprised him and he swerved. He nearly lost it. Didn’t, thankfully, but the car of course was confused and laid on their horn. A few of the other riders chewed out my buddy. I did too, telling him we need to be single file on the heavier trafficked roads. And it hit me, I don’t want to ride with him anymore.

So later that day I told him I’ll be riding by myself for awhile. I feel SO bad. But I really don’t want to ride with him anymore. I learned later on that day that I am not the first to drop him like this. In all my years of riding this is the first time I’ve had to drop someone. And it feels awful. It makes me feel like I don’t want to invite anyone on my rides anymore.

Does this happy to you all? I enjoy group rides, but I don’t think I’ll offer up my solo rides again.

1682475111.0,I guess I'm a cyclist now.,"So I turned 31 recently. I've been playing around on Zwift since the beginning of the year just as a way to lose some of the holiday weight I had gained. In Zwift my FTP is supposedly 210 and I've been on the bike every day since January 2nd with only a small handful of exceptions.

I did 31 miles to celebrate 31 years on this earth and I felt great! I did it in 1 hour 52 minutes and at the end I felt like I could have kept going for much longer. This is the second outdoor ride this year and the first one I've done even close to this distance. I averaged 17mph during the ride, and peaked at 25 with a tailwind.

I loved it, and I can't stop thinking about going racing, either in a bike race specifically or a triathlon due to my history with running and swimming.

Anyway, I've joined your cult and would like to know the secret handshake please. Thanks!",cycling,2023-04-26 02:11:51
1560866360.0,"Judge rules London cyclist did nothing wrong but still has to pay 50% compensation to pedestrian who was looking at her phone and walk out in front of him because he did not account for people ""behaving in unexpected ways""","https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/payout-for-yoga-teacher-hit-by-cyclist-as-she-crossed-road-on-her-phone-a4169716.html

As a Londonist cyclist this is obviously a crazy decision. A city packed full of people has idiots doing stupid and unexpected things all the time. This is a perfect example of obeying all the rules, doing everything right, and still getting screwed by a system that hates cyclists.

Edit: A lot of people seem to be coming down on the fact the horn was used and this would reduce the braking efficiency. 

I don't know the full details of the case, what is unclear is the details on the bike, if it was fixed wheel with a front brake this leaves a hand free to ring a bell. Further, I am able to ring a bell or honk a horn and brake at the same time. It is not clear the cyclist did not do this also. If you can't ring your bell and brake, reposition it. Further, according to Sheldon Brown the front braking only is most efficient and fastest way to stop your bike.

However these are details, the key point is the judge actually said they DID NOT find the cyclist was driving dangerously. This is the really extraordinary thing - and to me would seem the judge is finding that even though the cyclists did everything right they were still liable and responsible for the actions of everyone else on the road.",cycling,2019-06-18 13:59:20

1597325828.0,"At the grand old age of 19, I finally learnt how to ride a bike!","When I was a kid, my mum tried to teach me how to ride but I was so terrible that we kinda just gave up. I've always been so self conscious and ashamed about not being able to ride a bike ever since, especially seeing young kids being able to do something so easily that I, technically an adult, can't. 

Recently, I've become even more aware of this with university (I really want to ride a bike to my classes!) and my 20th birthday coming up so I asked for a bike as an early birthday present (a gorgeous Pashley Poppy). 

As I was so self conscious, I tried learning in my backyard first but it was really difficult as the lack of space meant that I couldn't cycle fast or long enough to get some balance. Eventually, I decided to walk my bike to my local woods and try it there.

Within half an hour I was able to cycle for a couple of seconds which felt brilliant! After I felt confident enough to try cycling on the pavement (there weren't any pedestrians around), I was amazed at how easy it was compared to muddy ground or grass.

I still find it difficult to get started sometimes, I can only do gentle turns, and I'm only comfortable cycling where there aren't any cars. However, being able to cycle back home was honestly amazing. It sounds cheesy but once you start pedalling and the resistance lessens, it really does feel like flying. Being able to cycle by other cyclists or cycling in view of other people also felt extremely validating.

Anyways, I just wanted to share my excitement about being able to ride a bike for the first time. For any other people who can't ride a bike at all (like me, a couple of hours ago), I really recommend going to an open place with no people. Getting started was the most difficult part for me since I kept getting unbalanced and steering off but I would recommend trying to push through it as even if you start unbalanced, it probably will only last a few seconds until you gather enough momentum to actually start riding.

Also, definitely experiment with which feet you start with. I kept trying with my right foot since I assumed that it was my dominant foot but it's actually much easier with my left because my right foot was better at getting on the second pedal.

1631884131.0,My Wife Won LoToJa!,"My wife recorded the fastest time at LoToJa this past weekend with a time of 9:44:15.7. Even though she is still just a Cat4 rider, she kicked it into another gear with 10 miles remaining and came in over a minute ahead of the Cat1 ladies she had been working with all day. Some quick stats, she is five foot four, her most recent ftp pegged her at 230watts and her power to weight ratio is 4.34. Also, I just realized not everyone probably knows what LoToJa is, it’s the longest one day amateur road race in the US at like 204 miles and has right around 8,000 feet of climbing.

I’ve been lurking for about a year (because that’s about how long my wife has been cycling) and I had to brag to someone because almost know one in my circle of friends comprehends how bad ass the feat she just pulled off is.

Backstory. My wife is previously already a pretty exceptional endurance athlete. She qualified for and ran the Boston marathon, and has completed a full Ironman (with almost no training on the bike or swimming). Anyway, after she gave birth to our son, it really jacked up her hips. She ended up needing to get a joint fused, and her road to recovery from his birth was like 3 years. Even when she was recovered, running just wasn’t the same because of the amount of pain it would cause her going past 5 miles and it would take her literally a week to recover from the havoc it caused her body with her fused SI joint. 

Fast forward to late summer 2020 and she decided she would try to take biking a bit more serious since we had gotten a Peloton for her to work out on through the pandemic. She was pretty dang talented from the get go (according to her strava segments) so she set the goal to ride LoToJa. She religiously did Matt Wilpers power zone rides through the winter and 3+ hour outdoor rides as soon as the weather permitted in the spring (we live in SLC). 

Race day came and she absolutely demolished the course and the field. Her goal now is to get to Cat3 and then Cat2 as quickly as possible so she can start riding in other races with some top tier competitors. 

If you stuck around, thanks for listening to my pride rant about my wife. Stay safe out there on the roads. 

TL/DR: My wife is an absolute f*cking bad-ass warrior of a woman and took first in LoToJa with only a year of serious cycling training.",cycling,2021-09-17 13:08:51

1522114547.0,Why is elitism so prevalent in the cycling community?,"I have a lot of hobbies, and I must say that the most pretentious group of people I deal with who share my interests are cyclists. (Maybe photographers are a close second)

I was 3/4 of the way through a 60 mile ride yesterday and bumped into 2 cyclists. I am on a temporary cheap bike I bought just to use on this trip I am on. Still a very decent bike specialized sirrus elite. I am loving riding it so far. 

The guys were on nice entry level carbon bikes. Within 30 seconds of chatting with them they took out the time to trash my bike. Saying it was heavy, and didn't know how I could have ridden it so far. I bit my tounge because my real bike is more expensive then theirs, and they were turning around after 5 miles. 

This has been a consistent thing that has always turned me off from associating with cyclists. My first real road bike purchase years ago was a Specialized Allez, that I saved up for all summer and was my pride and joy. I stopped by the local triathlon store and the owner called my bike cheap, and trashed the way I had it kitted out. 

Then there is the dirty looks when I am out for a ride in regular gym clothes, not pretending to be a team rider. Or good forbid riding my fancy bike in flip flops just trying to run to the store. 

I can't stand this attitude people have that you need to be in full spandex, on a $7500 bike to even be taken seriously as someone who enjoys cycling. I try to set a better example and encourage everyone to try it, and be happy with whatever bikes they have that fits their budget. ",cycling,2018-03-27 01:35:47

1624222402.0,Kinda shook up from Friday,"So this is going to be a little crazy. I feel like there has to be people who can relate or can offer something to help me through this. 

For the last few weeks I have been doing group rides with some co-workers. These guys are great cyclists. Really helping me get better on hills and such. I gained a lot of weight during the pandemic and was in pretty good shape before that. I weight about 245lbs (the heaviest of our group).

So anyways we are out smashing hills and doing about 25 miles and 2,000 ft of climb. 
Typically I am at the back of the train, and I am huffing and puffing pretty good by the end. But all in all I see myself getting better each week. 

So after this great ride Friday, I head home and take a shower. Getting ready to head out for a night out to celebrate Father’s Day with my wife. 

We leave our driveway and make it less than a half mile. I see on the corner of an intersection a group of people standing around a guy laying spread eagle on the ground. There are bikes near by. I whip in and jump out. The people are standing there. His riding partner is  super freaked out. I asked what happened and he keeps saying “I don’t know, I don’t know!”
I check for a pulse and feel nothing. See no breathing. I immediately start in CPR. 911 is called and on the way as I’m starting. My wife’s father is a Chiropractor so I tell my wife to call him. I continued till the EMS showed up. 

To wrap this up. I’m not sure this guy made it. I feel like I did all I could. But I’ve been having wicked crazy dreams. A crazy post ride event that has me kinda shook still. Maybe because how hard I’ve been pushing myself lately. I’m only 35 and not bad health per se’. 

Turns out the guy was climbing the hill by our house. It’s no bunny slope. Maybe a few hundred feet of climb. He was feeling unwell so they turned around and went back down. 


Any advice on how to get around this? I know it’s hard to talk about the darker side of something we all love, but I can’t seem to shake this one.

I listened to your tips: did a bike fit, changed the seat, tried to get as comfy as possible on the bike, and I started pedalling at a constant pace. No data on the screen, only my HR on the Apple Watch. And it was so much better! When i started using the trainer I literally struggled to complete a 4kms route, but today I learned about how to manage myself. Lot of water, steady pace, and i finished my first 10+ kms route (well, 11 actually!). Yes, it took me like 1 hour but it felt good! I feel like I could've done even more, my legs felt nice, but it's okay. I wanted to thank you for how nicely you guys welcomed me!

Interestingly I didn't each anywhere near as much as I was expecting to (though I did have a bacon sandwich and a cake at the cafe stop...). I get plenty of gels and an energy bar leftover.

1694014124.0,Assaulted while riding,"I (22F) am a bike commuter and I get off work around 10:30 at night and until now I’ve never had a problem. There’s a paved & lit bike path I take that’s almost a straight shot from my job to my house. My work uniform is pretty suggestive, so I’m used to getting catcalled by men walking on the path/other riders/people in cars, but the other night I had an experience that terrified me. I was biking home along my usual path when a man blocked my path. He stood in front of my bike, moving when I moved so I couldn’t go forward without hitting him. I slowed down, said something like “dude just be cool” and saw an opening to speed past him. Just as I took the opening, he punched me, hitting me on the side of my ribs. 

I made it home ok and I’m generally unscathed, but I’m posting now to ask if anyone knows about any self defense items specifically targeted to bikers, or has any advice for what i could’ve done to protect myself in the moment.

They must have been going 50-55mph. The car went halfway into the other lane to make the pass but then had to swerve back into the lane since there was oncoming traffic. It felt very unsafe.

I'm a larger/heavy rider and I was recently shopping for parts for a lightweight hillclimb bike I want to build, afterwards I had a takeaway meal with the family and the next day my weight increase was more that I would have saved modifying the bike.

1693152614.0,"Coming to terms that I'm at ""square one.""","Today is my 38th birthday. In my early to mid 20's I was a cyclist. I was riding 1500-2000 miles a year and doing multiple organized rides. I never hesitated to sign up for the longest distance offered and would regularly do 50 miles with my wife, brother, and friends. I gave up cycling in lieu of running after a move to NJ (very flat... cycling became a chore.) I ran two marathons with my wife, we got pregnant just before the second, and since then (2014) ive been more or less a couch potato.

We have since moved back to PA where we have nice elevation changes and cycling can be fun again. I went from weighing 220-240 up to 370 this past January after about 10 years and 3 children. I'm back to about 310 now. I bought a new gravel/touring bike and have taken it out twice with a commitment to continue losing weight and be back to riding centuries by the time I'm 40.

I'm having a hard time coming to terms with how far I've declined. My first ride, I set out to do 12 miles thinking I'd be slow but would manage just fine. By mile 5 I was in over my head. I cut the ride short and finished just shy of 9 miles in 56 minutes with 688ft of elevation according to Strava.

1595599859.0,If you’re on the fence about joining a group ride...,"Just do it. 

(Edit added at bottom, FYI)

I had been wanting to get into a group ride for months. I kept going back and forth with hesitations and concerns, but all that was put to rest when I finally just decided to go and see what it was like. I had a great time the first time I attended a group ride and now I go to at least a couple every week. 

It’s a great way to keep motivated, push yourself to new goals, meet people, and explore new routes. 

Here are some of my experiences and some advice for anyone who wants to try it but keeps putting it off for some reason. 

1) **how to find a ride:** check the websites of local bike shops and see if they organize any weekly group rides. Most shops will have this info online, as well as the approximate distance and average group speed. This is a good way to start since the rides are listed publicly, meaning anyone is invited and welcome to show up, and you can pick a ride that matches with your abilities for distance and speed. Once you do a few rides and meet some people, you’ll probably get invited to some other rides those people organize or attend, and you can start branching out into different groups and different routes that way.

2) **speed/pace:** whatever speed you can sustain as a solo rider, add 2-4mph to that number (depending how strong you are) to get an idea of what speed you’d be able to maintain in a group when others are helping block the wind for you. I.E. if you know you can sustain 19mph on flat ground with calm winds, you should be fine to join a group ride with an average speed of 21-23mph. 

3) **the difference between drop rides and no-drop rides:** no-drop means the group waits up for slower riders, or has agreed-upon regroup points if anyone falls behind. Drop rides are the opposite. Keep up with the group or be left behind.

4) **meeting people:** you don’t have to know anyone before you show up. If the ride is posted online for anyone to see, just show up and nobody will bat an eye. If it says the ride leaves at 8am, get there 10 minutes early. People might say hi or introduce themselves, or they might not. You can always introduce yourself and let them know it’s your first time on the ride. But once the ride starts you don’t need to worry about social interaction awkwardness because everyone’s just going to be riding and not talking much. This was a big sticking point for me. I hate being the “new guy” in situations like that, but I was happy to find that there were only a few minutes of awkwardly waiting before everyone hopped on the bike and started riding. Plus, each week you do the same ride you see the many of the same faces and start making conversation. It gets friendly very quickly. 

5) **riding in a pace line:** I was a little intimidated by this also since I had only read about it online or watched videos. I didn’t know if I’d subtly mess something up and do something unsafe for the group. The good news is: people are pretty chill and every group is different. So the hand signals and verbal cues of each group will be a little different. 

The things you should be comfortable doing before your first ride: keeping a consistent distance behind the person in front of you, never overlapping wheels, pointing out obstacles on the road (hand signal), signaling turns (hand signal), signaling stops or slowdowns (verbal or hand signal), if you find yourself in front, signaling that you are going to pull out of line and drop back (hand signal). 

Those are the basic skills you’ll need to be safe in a paceline. If you can do those things, nobody will be upset that you’re there, and you’ll learn even more about signaling, riding in a group, and being safe as you keep attending rides.  

If you aren’t familiar with some of these skills, check out some great YouTube videos explaining all about riding in a paceline. That’s how I got a basic familiarity before showing up for my first group ride. 

6) **equipment:** most group rides are for people on road bikes. Sometimes I’ll see someone on a gravel bike with skinny tires at a road ride, but you don’t see people on hybrids or mountain bikes or fitness bikes. If you don’t own a road bike, you should check to see if the ride specifies that any bike type is welcome. If they don’t specifically mention any bike type, you probably should only attend if you have a road bike (or maybe gravel bike if you’ve got the right tires). This isn’t people being stuck up. It’s for the group pace and group safety. 

Edit to add: a commenter brought up tri-bikes. Generally tri-bikes are either frowned upon, or outright banned from group road rides. You need your hands near the brakes always.

Aside from the proper bike, always wear a helmet. Group rides take safety very seriously. You won’t be allowed to ride without a helmet. Other items to carry: water, spare tube/stuff to change a tire, and some rides may require lights. 

Oh, and everyone will be wearing spandex/Lycra. Just buy some bibs and a cycling jersey if you don’t already have them. Everyone else will be wearing them, so you’ll fit right in. There are all body types on these rides, so don’t be self conscious at all. I’ve seen guys with a bit of a gut in tight jerseys, I’ve seen women with large chests in tight jerseys, I’ve seen people of all genders with massive thighs in tight bibs. Seriously, nobody cares, and nobody is judging you. Everyone is just there to ride bikes and have fun. You’ll stick out more if you **don’t** wear the kit. 

7) **miscellaneous:** when you show up to a ride the first time, feel free to hang near the back until you get a feel for the pace, hand signals, and route. If you don’t want to move up the line and get closer to having to pull up front, just make some space and invite the rider to get in front of you when you see someone dropping back. That way you’ll stay near the back until you feel comfortable moving up the line. 

Mistakes happen. If you signal too late, accidentally half wheel someone, or anything else, just offer a quick “sorry,” and all will be forgiven. Everyone is working hard and everyone understands mistakes happen when we are tired. Don’t be intimidated by not wanting to make a mistake. 

Know your limits and ride within them. Don’t show up to a 25+mph group ride for your first time. Those riders are probably very serious and would be less forgiving of newbies or mistakes. If you start solidly within your skill limits, you’ll have fun and want to go back again. As you get familiar with the customs of group rides and get stronger, you will feel more confident to show up to those faster/longer rides. 

—

Those are the things that I was really nervous about before my first group ride. I hope this post helps some people get inspired to try their first group ride and have fun riding bikes with others! 

If I’ve forgotten anything or if anyone has questions or clarifications about anything I’ve mentioned, feel free to mention it. I’ll add things to the post if they seem relevant. 

Happy riding, everyone!

Edit to add: 

People are bringing up social distancing concerns with group riding. This is totally valid and something to consider. 

You should do your research and find out if based on your location, local government guidelines, and other risk factors this is an activity you’d like to engage in now, or wait until a later date. 

I totally support people making informed choices about their health and doing the right thing for their families and communities. This post is not meant to downplay social distancing issues, but merely to share my perspective in case it’s useful to anyone now or in the future as you decide to join a group ride.",cycling,2020-07-24 14:10:59

No
I
Am
NOT.

I Google ‘best exercise for overweight, bad back’, top results: rowing and cycling. I buy a Chinese knockoff Concept rowing machine from Amazon and i own a ‘99 Giant mountain bike that i rode 3times/yr in the city, on a good year.

I live just off the Mount Vernon Trail that George took to work to DC along the Potomac River.

I YouTube search ‘stretching routine for overweight, bad back’ and click on most viewed. I stretch before/after every single ride.

April 1, 2020 i take my first bike ride, just 2 miles away from my house, and 2mi back home. I had to get off and walk the bike up a 15ft 8% grade hill, humbling. 3wks later when i finally rode up that hill without loosing cadence was my 1st sense of accomplishment and real progress.

If i wake up and it doesn’t still hurt, i do it again.
If i wake up and it does still hurt, i take rest and recovery SERIOUSLY and eat good protein and vegetables, drink alot of water, take epsom salt soaks, stretch routine, stay off feet and take it ez.
If i wake up the next morning and it still hurts, i repeat rest and recovery steps.
If i wake up and it doesn’t still hurt, i do it again.

The world gets smaller and smaller..

July 13 2020 i make it Washington monument, Lincoln, and Jefferson w/ old bike. 15mi from home, 15 back.

I buy a proper gravel bicycle in July 15.
I keep riding.
I decide to ride to all the houses of my 3 closest friends in DC area.
Furthest friend is 22mi from home, 22 back.
I realize Baltimore is only 56mi to the Ray Lewis statue, and his cycling in Florida heat had already been super inspirational for me back when i read it in 2012.
I just rode 44mi, i COULD ride to Bmore..

My metabolism naturally normalizes.
My circadian rhythm naturally regulates.
My brain chemistry has begun to balance as a result of daily exercise, proper recovery, eating right.
My eyes are opened that i was indeed suffering from depression the past decade and i had no idea and this exercise has begun to bring me out of the depressive fugue.

I realize i have let relationships with people i love fallow as a by product of my downward spiral of undiagnosed mental health disorder for the past decade.
I should ride my bike to all of my friends houses, not just DC friends, in progressive distance away from my house. This will naturally increase my mileage.
I will not kill any 2 birds with 1 stone for the 8 stages of the Tour de Friends that live in Bmore, but will back and forth 8 times.

The furthest Bmore stage is 73mi.

I make two 175mi oneway trips to the Eastern Shore of Maryland where i was born, from Bmore stages to visit 14 stages of friends and family that still live there. This is practice for what i have that’s superfluous and what i wish i had that i don’t yet.

I make the 2nd ride Eastern Shore from Parkville in Bmore to 146th St in Ocean City, MD in one day, 173.5 miles, 21hrs, 13.5hrs on bike, 7.5hrs refilling water on 104*F day, eating 3000 calorie lunch and 3000 dinner and eating my leftover BBQ wrapped in tinfoil from lunch at 3am on side of a road in farmland of Delaware by moonlight, eating ribs and brisket…Xd. My Whoop heart rate monitor says i burnt 11,000 calories that day!!!

2 miles to start, 173.5..if i woke up and it didnt hurt, i did it again. It hurt the next 2 days i woke up after that!

Then i put back tire in Atlantic on Assateague Island and head to the very non-local friends across the country.

I will put the front tire in the Pacific.
Come along.

I am so thankful for that kidney stone! Dr. King said in his famous I Have a Dream speech, which i was profoundly struck by how it applied to this life change i experienced the last 9mos by the 1st time i could make it to his statue:

“..Out of the mountain of despair, a stone of Hope.”

I am 26F who started cycling this year on April. I had a road bike which was
super old, terrible condition and wayyy too big for me. Of course at the beginning I had not realized those things 😅 So on April I could cycle 20km/h on average speed, and after 20km I was super tired.

Yesterday (21st August) I participated in my first race (50km)!!!! I finished 4th in my age group with the average speed around 33km/h!!!! The official time is 1:31:10!
After finish, I just started crying out of the excitement!!! It was such a nice moment!!!  Wow! It was such a great race!",cycling,2022-08-22 08:13:52
1613169283.0,advice for fat riders from a former 300lb cyclist,"i see an awful lot of people asking for bike advice for the heavier rider here, and as someone who began riding at 300lb and worked my way down to 175 i really think a lot of the advice is off base and given by people who have unrealistic ideas about what fat people do and don't need.

what i see more often than not is someone in the area of 280 to 300lb, just about the point where people tend to get tipped off that they need to be more active but where they're aware that they're a decent fraction heavier than the average person, asking about what bike is right for them. well, i was that person once, and here's the route i took both starting out and as i started to lose weight.

i started on a [trek verve 2 hybrid](https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bikes/hybrid-bikes/recreation-bikes/verve/verve-2/p/17367/), it cost about $450. the number one problem i encountered was keeping the rear wheel in true. that's to be expected, because the bottleneck in terms of weight is always gonna be wheels and tires. the wheels that they put on bikes at this pricepoint are just not fantastic and aren't going to stand up to serious daily use at that weight. i ended up having it replaced with a 36-spoke mavic A319 rear wheel. the other thing I did wrong was running the 45mm tires right at the limit, i really could have run them lower without fearing pinch flats too much but i was afraid of doing so because of my weight. in retrospect i should have been running them lower the whole time because that would have decreased the load on the wheels, but hindsight is 20/20

as my time with that bike wore on and i started dropping a bit of weight i installed a set of panaracer pasela tires in 35mm and wow, what a difference. quality tires make everything a lot smoother and make you more confident. i still keep a clipping of the sidewall even after they wore out because they're the tires that clued me in to how wonderful the sensation of riding a bike can really be.

my next bike was a [rivendell roadini](https://www.rivbike.com/products/roadini). at that point i'd dropped to about 250 and begun really liking cycling, both working on my own bikes and riding them, so i decided to build a good road bike from the frame up. i got a set of custom wheels built up, alexrims G6000 rims on tiagra hubs 36 spoke front and rear, for about $200. they were fantastic wheels. i've long since sold them but in my entire time riding them neither one ever went even slightly out of true. to be perfectly honest i overshot it, they were something like 2600g the set but they worked great for a time. sturdy wheels don't need to be expensive but they are going to be heavy, and wheel weight really does affect how light-feeling your bike is. there's various analyses of how much it actually matters in raw speed but the subjective experience is clear: don't run wheels heavier than necessary for longer than you need to.

i grew dissatisfied with the roadini after a season's riding because of the position it put me in. not the bike's fault, love rivendell, my riding just got too aggressive for the tall front end of that bike. i was about 220 at this point and still had some funny fat-guy ideas about how many spokes i really needed, so my next bike (another frame-up build, a [black mountain monstercross](https://blackmtncycles.com/shop/frames/monstercross-v5-5-frameset/), the nicer big brother of the surly crosscheck) had another set of 36 spokes front and rear - pacenti brevet rims on 105 hubs. these wheels i had absolutely no end of trouble with. built by the same people, same spokes, used with more or less the same tire size, but i couldn't for the life of me keep the things in true. frankly i think they were just crap rims for people above the average cyclist's weight but i couldn't say for sure. they're doing fine so far as i know in the ownership of a \~150lb rider.

after a while retruing those wheels i had a discussion about rim stiffness and strength with some experienced mechanics at the bike shop and concluded that at my weight i'd probably be OK with some low spoke count wheels so long as they're quality. i got a set of industry nine i25tl wheels, 20 spokes in front and 24 in back with very nice aluminum rims from HED and sapim CX-rays, the nicest spokes on the market. they were an absolute revelation. super stiff and incredibly strong, i've had them for about a year now and i still haven't needed to true them. they even survived the crash that killed that black mountain frame - that 20-spoke front wheel tweaked the steel fork to the side and ruined it while remaining perfectly straight itself. would they have worked at 300lb? maybe not. but i think i probably could have run them at 230-250 to be perfectly honest.

so what's the takeaway from all this in terms of what i would say - and what i would want others to in turn advise - to heavier riders looking for advice?

* you don't need a touring bike. that might have been true twenty or more years ago but any reasonably modern hybrid is going to be more than strong enough in the frame. touring bikes will work if you can find one, but they're a rare and expensive proposition to anyone looking to dip their toe into cycling. before i got into it $450 was a lot to spend on a bike and i'd hate for anyone to stay away from this wonderful world because they think they need a whole bike specifically for their weight.
* stop telling people they should get mountain bikes because of their weight if they say they want to ride on the road, pavement, and gravel. again, maybe that was the answer 20+ years ago, but i would never have discovered the joy of effortlessly carving corners on the asphalt if i were feeding my energy into a suspension fork and crawling around on big knobby tires. horses for courses, no matter your weight.
* get a sturdy rear wheel at least. your front wheel you can take or leave, most 32-spokes are going to be strong enough because more weight rests on the rear wheel. that's why touring bikes get recommended, because they have super-sturdy wheels to begin with. it's not that expensive to get one to replace your stock wheel and it'll pay for itself in retruing, trust me.
* once you start dropping weight your bike will become heavier as a total percentage of your weight and you'll start noticing it more. keep an eye on your weight and don't think you'll always need things to be as durable as they did at 300lb.
* spoke count is not destiny. good, high-tension wheels with stiff rims will stand up to way more than you think even if they only have a few spokes and not every wheel with 32-36 spokes will be sturdy. a lot has happened in this realm since sheldon brown and jobst brandt died, and even more since they stopped listening to anybody's opinions on the matter.
* good tires are for everyone, not just skinny guys. there are lots of tires that feel really good available in sizes 35mm and above. don't think that because you're heavier you need to ride heavy, thick touring tires too.

if there's anyone who's gone through a similar experience who can chime in with any advice or details I missed feel free. hope this helps you out if you're looking for advice!",cycling,2021-02-12 22:34:43
1635949375.0,[Vent] I can’t stand it when guys in group rides call unnecessary gendered attention to women on the rides.,"Yesterday a woman who had never ridden with our group before showed up to our regular Tuesday ride. The ride is almost always just men.

To be clear: nobody was rude. Nobody was overtly sexist. Nobody mansplained to her how her disc brakes need to be bled. 

So good job on that, dudes! 

But it still is crazy to me to see the type of attention a female rider gets from men. 

When the ride leader posted some pictures on Facebook these were some of the comments: 

“Wow, letting the girl do all the work up front? Step up, guys!”

“Official petition to change the name of the ride to [woman’s name]’s Ride!” 

“The wind was tough yesterday, but thankfully we had some girl power to help us through!”

And during the ride, while everyone was polite, she kept getting so much more attention than anyone else usually gets. People laughing really hard at her jokes, even if they weren’t that funny. People who are usually very reserved and don’t talk much wanting to engage her in conversation at every red light. 

Why is it so hard to just treat a woman like any other rider? 

I’d be especially interested to hear from any women who ride with a lot of men how these kinds of things come across to you. Does it make the ride less enjoyable? Or is it a neutral, or even a positive thing to get all this attention? 

Maybe I’m extra sensitive to things like this because my wife has said she doesn’t like riding with men because of this type of behavior. 

So I’m just throwing this out there: guys, next time there’s a woman on your ride see if you can treat her just like any other rider. It would be great to make group rides a super welcoming space for any type of rider.",cycling,2021-11-03 14:22:55

1701698138.0,Witnessed Graphic Bike Fatality- Don’t Know How To Ever Ride Again,"Edit/Update: Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  I love our cycling community and all of your comments I have taken to heart.  I am currently playing Tetris and have reached out to a Trauma Specialist.  I am a therapist myself but have to tell you I have been so rattled that I really needed the support and direction.  Thank you for sharing all of your stories.  We are such a powerful group of survivors. ❤️


I was the first responder to a fatal graphic cyclist death on Saturday.  It happened 10 feet in front of me.  I am incredibly traumatized and continue to replay the event over and over in my head.  I was riding behind the cyclist and both of us were doing a long distance ride of about 130 miles. This community is small and I don’t want to share specific details to protect the family.

I am feeling not only incredible grief for the individual, but also loss for myself as I can’t imagine getting back on my bike ever again.  The heartbreak is that I absolutely love and have the deepest passion for long distance riding.  I have seen many bike accidents and falls over the miles but this was literally next level for me and I can’t unsee it. 

I just wondered if anyone has had this experience and been able to find your love of cycling again.  How did you get back on your bike?

1685303347.0,What happened to the Texas teen who crashed into cyclists while rolling coal on them?,"Late 2021 in Waller County, Texas the teenage son of a well connected local family rolled coal on six cyclists and crashed onto them, causing serious injuries.

Update: yes, and per link to older thread below (thanks) no word on the criminal charges but the civil lawsuit is proceeding against the driver and his passenger (who IIRC was recording it) and their parents.

1595255213.0,I heckled a driver (and I'm kind of proud of myself...),"I was inspired to write this after I saw a post today about a rider being heckled during a ride.

In my neighborhood I ride on the road. There are no bike lanes and the sidewalks are very narrow and usually pretty packed. The roads are one lane but are usually wide enough for cars to safely overtake the bikes. However, in intersections and traffic circles I take  the lane to minimize risk and make myself more visible. 
I was riding and heading toward  a traffic circle, and the car behind me did not pass me. So I took the lane, and entered the circle to turn left. As I was going through the circle the car passed me on the left (inside of the circle) and tried to cut me off to go straight, while yelling that I had no right to be on the road. I started yelling back at the driver that I was also avehicle and he illegally and dangerously passed me. I also yelled at him to stop the car, so he followed me out of the circle. 
I pulled up at his passenger window and he started yelling that I was being unsafe. So I said to him: ""you would never pass and cut off a car in a traffic circle, why would you do it to a bike"". I may have raised my voice at him...

Myself and one of my friends was able to avoid it but my other friend who war riding to my left was not able to avoid it. He was sent flying into the air, received a compound arm fracture, broke some ribs (with partially collapsed lung) and has spinal fractures. The rage I had/have at the driver is immense. I believe it was a genuine accident but D@%% does it piss me off. My friend will likely be OK in the long run but has a 9 month recovery in front of him post spinal surgery. Luckily he had no head trauma thanks to the good Lord and his helmet. I am really just venting on here. I feel a little bit guilty that I am 100% fine with not a scratch and he will spend the next week in the hospital and then the next 9 months rehabing. 🤬 For the love of God please look out for bicycles and motorcycles before you try to make a turn in your car. We were riding on a very safe road but how quickly it went from clear in front of us to now a car is in front of us was less than a second. Now all of the people who have always said that cycling is dangerous are having their ""I told you so moment."" All of our wives are demanding that we sell our bikes and stop riding. So, probably gonna take a week off from the bike while things calm down and just reevaluate. Thanks for letting me vent 😔

UPDATE: Thanks everyone for the encouraging words. My buddy came out of his spinal surgery today and everything is looking like he will ultimately be fine in the long run. The healing road will be long. The crash happened Thursday morning, it's Friday night and I am really jonesin' for a ride. I think I will probably to a ride tomorrow where I average 15mph on bike paths only.

Also, in our crash, we had our headlights on steady (I will likely start using ""blinking"" thanks to some of your suggestions.) We had our tail lamps on solid.

My friend who was injured called me this evening and asked ""what happened?"" I explained how one second we were cruising along happily loving life and the next second, the car who was trying to turn just went and there was no time to talk, let alone brake. I don't know how much will stick with him since he is on some pretty good pain meds after his 2 surgeries.

Yall are great for being positive and encouraging. I have found a sport that I love and am not looking to give it up anytime soon. Probably will do a slow short ride on bike trails tomorrow!

I was coming back into my neighborhood the back way on a cement path through a park and slowed down to go through a patch of water an inch or two deep. I guess there was some slime and mud beneath the surface because the wheels both slid to the left and I went down. The right rear part of my helmet slammed into the path hard.

It hurt so much that at first I thought the helmet must have come off but it was still strapped in place. I was dazed but conscious and lying in muddy water.  After a bit I got up and determined that no bones were broken.

I walked the bike home because I felt a bit unsteady. I went to work later at my hospital but didn't feel good. My head ached, my ears were ringing, and I felt like I was in a daze. One of the ED physicians assessed me and determined that I have a concussion. He wanted me to check in and get a CT scan but even with insurance that's expensive and I opted not to.

Now I'm home and feel pretty crappy but I know that had I not been wearing a helmet I'd be either dead or in an ICU somewhere. I'm really thinking of getting some tires with some grippier tread on them.

I generally ride a minimum of 6,000 miles a year, of which a good chunk is in and around the very large city where I currently reside.  I have many, many thousands of miles riding in urban environments and have ridden in pretty much every major US city and most major European cities.   Riding in any urban environments has an inherently higher risk, but my city is notorious for not enforcing any traffic laws, which makes it that much more risky.  It is truly a Mad Max situation.  Just given the sheer number of miles I ride, I had been hit numerous times before this crash and I have no doubt I will be hit again.

In spring 2021, I was hit broadside by a young driver speeding through a red light at 40-50 mph (speed limit was 25 mph).  I was riding in a marked bicycle lane and my light had been green for a while, so this was not a case where someone was trying to beat the yellow and failed.  Out of habit, I looked up the road to make sure all the cars were stopped or stopping at the red light (a habit I developed many years ago that has saved me many times).  Unfortunately, this driver was going so fast, I did not look far enough up the road to see her.  There is another intersection right after this one, so I turned my attention to that intersection, which is the last thing I remember.  I had a total of five surgeries spanning almost 20 hours on the operating table addressing life threatening injuries.  I then spent three weeks in the hospital (half in the ICU) and another two weeks in a rehab hospital.  After that, I had in home PT for two months and then out patient PT that I am still attending.  When people ask what injuries I had, I joke that it would be faster to say what was not broken, punctured, and severed.

I’m going to break the rest of this post into two parts.  The first part is what I think one should do before/after a major crash, especially one involving an automobile and the second part will outline my recovery.  NOTE: I am not a lawyer and anything I say here is from my experience and should not be construed as legal advice.

**Part I: What I did/wish I would have done to prepare and what I did after I was hit**

* If you have an automobile, max out your uninsured/underinsured coverage.  The state minimum car insurance where I live is an absolute joke.  In my case, the other driver’s auto insurance only covered about 1.5% of my total medical bills.  I had to rely heavily on my uninsured/underinsured coverage.
* Before you need it, identify a lawyer to help you.  If your area has one, find a lawyer who specializes in bicycle crashes.  Save their information and have it handy.  My lawyer helped us navigate the insurance nightmare and has negotiated a settlement with the insurance company that I would never have been able to do on my own.  Yes, lawyers are expensive, but let me tell you, when you get that first rejection letter from your insurance company and you are looking at a close to 7 digit medical bill, that lawyer is worth every single penny (more on this below).
* Insurance is not your friend (Part 1).  Insurance will use any excuse not to pay.  The police department in my city “does not investigate auto accidents” and the police report was an absolute joke.  What was written in it is not physically possible, the location of where I was hit was wrong, and even the driver and the one witness the police interviewed had vastly conflicting stories.  At no point did the police ever attempt to interview me.  However, this one piece of paper was the catalyst for all insurance companies involved to deny my claims.
* Insurance is not your friend (Part 2).  I have really good medical insurance (by US standards).  Since I was hit by a car, the medical insurance initially refused to pay for any of my medical bills since it was classified as an ""automobile accident.""  I’m not going to go into great detail here because it will make a very long post infinitely longer, but I needed a lawyer to navigate this.  Depending on your insurance, they will possibly come after any money you collect from either your insurance or the driver's insurance company to cover what they outlaid (called subrogation.  See u/07030 comment below for a more detailed explanation).  Having a lawyer deal with this nightmare is worth every single cent you pay them.
* When riding, have some sort of tracking that someone who is not with you can see (Strava Beacon, Garmin LiveTrack, etc).  I was initially riding with a friend and I was hit shortly after separating from my riding partner.  I was by myself when the crash happened.  My Garmin head unit sent an incident alert to my wife and then she was able to track me to the correct hospital using Strava Beacon (there were four hospitals all about equal distance away from where I was hit).
* Ride with cameras.  I usually ride with a Go Pro, but this particular day, I was running late meeting my riding partner and I did not put it on.  If I would have had video footage showing the police report was wrong, it would have helped my lawyer tremendously and probably settled the insurance mess faster.
* Wear your helmet.  Wear your helmet.  Wear your helmet.  If  you remember nothing else from this post, remember this: WEAR YOUR F’ING HELMET!  If you can afford a bike, you can afford a helmet with MIPS or similar rotational-energy technology (SPIN, WaveCel, etc.).  I was told my survival rate would have only been 10-15% if I had not been wearing a helmet (by wearing a helmet, it increased the survival rate to about 60% on account of the other injuries I sustained).
* Make yourself visible to drivers.  There are plenty of posts in this subreddit with details on what to do.  On the day I was hit, I had flashing lights on both the front and back, bright colored jersey, and a hi viz helmet.  Yeah, you might not look as cool as you would in an all black Ralpha kit, but I feel this setup delayed the inevitable as long as possible
* Your homeowners/renters insurance might help with equipment replacement cost.  Before you need it, check with them.  For me, I had a replacement rider on my renters insurance policy that basically allowed me to replace items with brand new items instead of giving me a depreciated dollar amount.  I was able to get a brand new bike that I would not have otherwise been able to afford (as well as replacing everything I was wearing that day and all the accessories on my bike).  Make sure you know the time frame to file a claim.  I only had 6 months and since the recovery was so long, I didn’t file until 5 months, 3 weeks and almost missed out.
* If you are hit, do NOT post details of it on social media.  See “Insurance is not your friend” part 1 & 2 above.  If you hire a lawyer, they will tell you the exact same thing.

**Part II: The Recovery**

While I was still in the ICU, I was told I would spend 4-8 weeks in a rehab hospital and then would have about 6 months of in home PT before starting outpatient PT.  As for bike riding, initial estimate was 9 months to a year before I was back riding outside on the road and a year to 18 months before I could do gravel and mtb again.  Of course, that was not going to work for me!  As soon as I got out of the ICU, I threw everything I had into getting better.  I did everything the Doctors and therapists told me to do.  By doing this, I was already gaining strength again by the time I went to the rehab hospital.

That first week in the rehab hospital sucked.  However, I did everything and pushed myself.  I threw myself into getting better and by the middle of the second week, I had already accomplished all the things I needed to be released to go home (I never thought I would have to learn how to wipe my own butt again in my 40s, but I had to successfully do that to go home!)

Once I got home, the hustle and bustle of the hospitals were replaced with being confined to a bed and boredom.  I figured at that point, if I couldn’t do anything fun, might as well eat everything I generally refrain from.  Oh man did that pizza and ice cream taste good, but it was a huge detriment to my waist line (and I continued to eat like that for quite a while).

At 8 weeks post op, I was given permission to start riding a trainer at minimal resistance.  I bought a kickr, had my wife pull the rain bike out of the garage, and started riding HERD rides on Zwift.  Initially, I could only ride for 5-10 mins without hurting.  By 12 weeks post op, I could ride for about an hour at around 1 W/KG.

At 12 weeks post op, I was given permission to start increasing resistance on the trainer, but to back off immediately if I felt pain.  I tried.  I really tried.  I immediately did a RAMP Test and threw up from the pain.  That led to a week in bed before I was able to get back on the trainer.  This time, I kept with the HERD rides and slowly increased my time and resistance.

At five months post op, I was given permission to start riding on the road again (again, initial estimate was minimum of 9 months).  No mountain biking, gravel riding, or hard efforts.  I actually waited a few more weeks before I ventured out.  Let me tell you, that first ride was fucking amazing.  Although my balance was crap (I almost hit a parked car while clipping in), I was loving it.  Took a bike path about 10 miles out of the city and tackled one of the steepest climbs in the area.  Barely made it to the top while bouncing off of my max HR and promptly relieved my stomach of all its contents.  I loved every second of it!

Over the next few months, I mixed it up with both Zwift and road riding, all the while continuing to chow down on pizza and ice cream (I regret nothing).

At 8 months post op, I was given permission to resume all activities.  This beat the most aggressive estimate by 4 months.  Right now, I am riding 100 – 150 miles/week between Zwift and the road.  I haven’t ventured out on the mountain bike yet, but hope to do that soon.  After the holidays are over, I am going to start back on my cycling nutrition plan and work on losing the 40 lbs I have gained since I was hit (did I mention eating pizza and ice cream is not good for your waist line?).

People ask me how I was able to return to riding on the road so quickly after such a horrific accident.  Honestly, cycling has been a part of my life for so long and has helped me through so much, there was never any doubt in my mind about returning to the road.  I was jumpy the first few rides, but my mental state is back to normal.  That said, where I previously would have ridden a bike in the city to go to the grocery store, appointments, etc., I will now take the car.  Currently, my city riding is to ride out of the city and into the less populated suburbs where the drivers are more cyclist friendly and then back to my house.

Another question I’m asked is what would I have done differently to avoid this accident.  My answer is nothing.  I did everything I could without being overly cautious.  I was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.  When you do risky things such as ride in a very populous urban area with a known lack of traffic enforcement, you have to realize things will go wrong at some point.

If you made it this far, thank you for reading.  I hope you gained something from this and stay safe out there!

About 20km in and I’m going up a small 6% climb with 2 bags on my rear rack so the climb is feeling a bit harder than usual. 

A car overtakes me and the passenger sticks his head out the window and says “C’mon mate, keep going, you can do it”. 

It put a smile on my face and it gave me an extra gear to keep pushing. I caught up to him at the next traffic light and said “thanks mate, I needed that” and he gave a chuckle and we departed. 

It’s a nice change of pace compared to the string of rude fingers, “faggot” and “use the footpath ya cunt” that I’m used to.

1589715302.0,Operation Fat B*****d - Update No 3.,"Hi All

I have had a lot of requests to keep you all posted on my journey. An one or two who seemed to have taken exception to them... but hey ho can't please everyone.

So I am on day 10 from the start which was posted here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/gg13eg/operation_fat_bd_begins/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share.

As a reminder I am alternating cycling and rest days day by day and decided quite quickly to start alternating the non exercise days to fasting days (600cal limit).

I have weirdly always been able fast for long periods through the day providing I don't start to eat... As when I start to eat I have to carry on eating? 

My rides have been a mixed bag, some days easier than others. Day 3 was really good, I thought go myself ""hey i got this"". Then I confidently strolled into  day 4 which was an absolute pig. Same route, same time of day... go figure!

But I am now consistently to the point where on my rides, I feel like I am only having my ass kicked by 3 ninja turtles instead of all 4! 

On Last night's ride I have halved my resting (stoppage) time from 10 minutes to 5 since starting - Aside from the massive hill at the start (18ish% gradient for 0.5miles), I don't walk the bike. I stop and then start again when my breath and muscles allow.

I have lost 6lbs, nearly half a stone. There's a lot more to be done but you guys inspire me. Your stories of couch potatoes to 100miles. 

That's where I wanna be!

I realise there's a lot of work to be done and diet is going to be a huge part of that. But for now I am content that I am cutting down and not gorging on so much crap. And the gentle muscle ache I feel gives me a weirdly satisfying comfort. 

I don't kill myself while exercising.. I have finally learned from that mistake. I take it at my own pace instead of carrying on like I am trying to prove something to somebody. 

I am amazed and really happy that my journey has inspired others to get back into cycling, get fit and lose some weight. If this unmotivated fatty can do it, anybody can!!

Your voices in my head.

You guys rock!",cycling,2020-05-17 11:35:02
1551980948.0,I overheard some people at a stop light making fun of me and I couldn't help but laugh.,"Hey guys, noob here. I wanted to share a funny moment from one of my very first rides. For background, I used to do a little bit of mountain biking in college but gave it up because maintaining and repairing the bike was too expensive for little old me. Fast forward to last year, I severely tore a muscle at the gym and the recovery process was an absolute pain in the ass. Since I can't do much in the way of lifting anymore, after I could walk around normally I was going insane and needed to find another way to stay in shape and burn off steam. A few months ago I figured I'd borrow my dad's old road bike from like the 1980s to give it a shot and see how I liked it. 

This thing was so much fun, even though you have to reach down to the bottom of the frame to change gears (it's super sketchy to try to change gears at speed) but it's got a lot of charisma and I got a lot of compliments riding it around town (mostly from men in their 50-60s). 

Since there's no point in spending a ton of money on something you're not even hooked on yet, I really didn't get much in the way of gear. The only thing I got was some Shimano shoes so that I can clip into these pedals (I've only fallen on my face twice at red lights so far). Otherwise, the only other stuff I'm wearing is gym shorts, a tshirt, an old mountain biking helmet, and a high-visibility vest (partly so that I don't get run over, but mostly because I want people 500 yards away to see how stylish I am). 

On my very first ride with the bike, I was trying to go for \~15 miles to see how it went. It was hotter than hell that day and I was only 2-3 miles into the ride before I get to the long uphill portion of the route. I'm in the lowest gear and it still doesn't feel low enough. I'm so out of shape. I'm sucking wind so I stopped at the corner of an intersection for a break, even though the light was green for me. To my right is the entrance for an area where a lot of mountain bikers go. About 20 feet in front of me was a car waiting to turn left and leave the park. The car was full of guys in their 20s with the windows rolled down. One of them looks over at me. I'm hyperventilating in my gym shorts, high visibility vest, and mountain biking helmet on a 40 year old bike. This guy points at me while laughing and says to his friends ""this guy has no fucking clue what he's doing."" 

At first I was so offended that he would say something rude within earshot of a complete stranger, and I was pissed off for the next few miles of the ride. And then the more I thought about it, the funnier I thought it was. I looked down at myself, saw how ridiculous I look and laughed, and said to myself ""yeah, he's totally right"" and had a great rest of the ride. 

&#x200B;

Moral of the story: don't take yourself too seriously, life's more fun when you let things roll of your back like water off a duck. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR: On my first ride I looked like a complete and total kook, a guy in a car said to his friends ""this guy has no fucking clue what he's doing."" ",cycling,2019-03-07 17:49:08

1610825713.0,Important life lessons can be found in every bike ride,"I went on a bike ride today and it was one of those rides where it was going terrible from the start, although I had 3 days off my legs were ruined after a mile, I couldn't put out any power, I was out of breath not long after setting off (not normal for me) and I was cycling at a snails pace, I was actually hating the experience. I considered turning around, calling it a day and going home. But I didn't. I carried on and eventually doubled the distance I was planning to cycle from 20 miles to 46. Not only that, I had so much fun, I got to the coast and caught a tailwind and was flying for miles, it was amazing. 

This made me realise how much of cycling can be a metaphor for life, how the lessons we learn from it are extremely important for every aspect of our lives.

- When you're going through hell, keep going - If I had turned around and gone home when I felt like crap at the start, I wouldn't have found that tailwind and had one of best bike rides I have had in months. Bad times happen to us all, but we must not give up, because we don't ever know what is waiting for us around the corner. 

- Pain, no matter how bad, will subside in time - further to my point above, it is very easy when you're going through pain to think that it'll never end, you lose hope and want to give up. But it will pass eventually. As long as you take the right steps you need to take, pace yourself correctly, recover and seek support when needed, it will pass.

- Life is a journey, not a destination - when out on the bike it is so easy to just focus on getting from A to B, as quick as possible, so much so that you neglect to notice the beauty that is surrounding you. I do this all the time. I focus on my destination, and forget that I should be enjoying the journey, that is what cycling is about. Same applies to life. Stop and admire the beauty in the world, enjoy where you are now and try not to focus where you are going next, be present and take each day as it comes. Life is too short.

The driver didn't stop, instead they took off. I didn't get any details and there were no witnesses (country-ish road) or cameras unfortunately.

My helmet cracked, my bike is all good, no scratches, cracks or dents in the carbon fibre that I can see.

I went to get some medical attention, I have a mild(ish) concussion and loads of gravel rash, but otherwise I'm ok.

1683308231.0,I need to stop treating every ride as a sprint or a marathon and just enjoy it,"I am always guilty of treating every single ride as if it were a sprint or a marathon, meaning that I always assign some kind of challenge to it, whether that be distance or speed, that I must achieve in order for me to feel like I have done something. 

On the one hand, this is a good thing, it means I am always challenging myself, pushing to do better and improving my performance. It can keep my motivated, especially when I see improvements. It is fun to try and beat my best or try for a KOM. 

On the other hand, it can ruin the fun of cycling for me. My perfectionism often means that I feel I always need to be making improvements, going faster, cycling further, this internal pressure often causes me to dread going out on the bike. Some days I want to go out but I will procrastinate, delay it, tell myself I'll go out another time when the weather is better, or some other excuse.

Today I just went out on a ride with no expectations, no plan of where to go, no goal, and I just enjoyed it. I took the time appreciate the feeling of being on the bike and the freedom I had to go anywhere, took in my surroundings and let the pressure go. It was a breath of fresh air.

1638763722.0,Did my first century and thought I was going to die. Learn from my fail!,"I did my first century ride on Friday and thought I was very prepared. Physically, yes. Mentally? Oh fuck not at all. I probably should have stopped at about mile 60, but I kept going out of stubbornness.

There are many posts here with tips for doing a century, so here are some things I would advise to others trying this for the first time that I haven't really seen mentioned much.

* I followed the advice of ""eat every 45 minutes"" but had nothing but chews and granola bars and failed to have a big enough meal at any point. (Note: this is especially tricky as I've had gastric bypass and could only eat about half a granola bar at a time.) I've done \~60mi rides on just snacks, but that doesn't cut it for 7+ hours moving time!
* Don't break so long that you lose your momentum. I did an out-and-back course from the trailhead, 30 miles each way for the first leg, and I came back to my car to stop for lunch at 60mi. I let myself sit for 20 minutes (set a timer on my phone) and it was WAY too long. Not because my legs were sore, but because my mind figured out how tired I was getting and it let the doubt creep in. That doubt lingered HARD and I really had a lot of second thoughts.
* Make sure your electronics are charged in advance. I forgot to plug in my cycling computer, and ran out of battery at about the halfway point. I still had my route recording on my Garmin, but I lost my power reading in front of me, and that screwed up my pacing.
* If there's a chance you won't finish before sundown, make sure to bring a headlight.
* Electrolytes are your friend! I had a 1.5L hydration pack full of water, but neglected to bring my bottles with Scratch mix and forgot about the salt tabs in my bag until late. My quads cramped quite badly and it was my own damned fault.
* When things get tough, break it down into 5mi increments. Ride 5, stop for a moment or two, then get back and keep going. It's a lot easier to face that down than a longer stretch of mileage.
* Have a morale buddy to support you when things get tough! I started texting my dad every time I stopped on the second lap, especially when it got down to 5mi segments, and it's probably about the only thing that kept me going.
* Come up with a mantra or motto when things get tough. I keep chanting ""just keep swimming, just keep swimming"" a la *Finding Nemo* and it got me through the worst.
* Also, make a playlist with all your favorite psych up songs. I totally forgot about this until the last 20mi, and my favorites like the Reel Big Fish version of ""Take On Me"" really helped me survive.
* Pack advil or tylenol in your first aid kit. My lower back started really hurting towards the end (haven't had a fitting on my new bike yet... oops) and it would have helped make things a lot less miserable.
* Having a good saddle is a lifesaver. After trying dozens of models, I ended up with an Infinity Saddle and aside from a bit of chafing towards the end, sit bone pain wasn't anything I had to worry about, thank gawd.
* When deciding to do this in the first place, consider your average pace on the route you're planning to take... and assume you can't keep that up the whole time. I average 15mph on my usual trail (yeah, I'm hella slow given how much I ride) so I estimated finish time based on that. By the time fatigue and saddle pain kicked in, and I really had to push through the mental quagmire of miles 60 - 80, my average speed for the whole ride was somewhere around 13.8.
* Oh yeah, last one... if you take meds for mental illness, it would SUCK if your pharmacy screwed up the refills and you had to go without your pills for a day or two before the big ride. (Yeaaaaaah. Normally I handle my bipolar and OCD pretty well but this was REALLY poor timing.)

That said? I'm still SUPER proud that I managed to pull this off. As someone who always sucked at sports, I am absolutely freakin' amazed that I rode this far. I'm not fast, I'm not skinny, I don't have the fanciest bike. But gosh darnit, I'm stubborn and I'm reasonably good at going moderately slowly for a very long time. There were times when it sucked, and there were times when it was awesome, and I'm very glad I gave it my best shot.

The longest one till today for me was around 60km so this was quite a jump and I have to say I'm pretty proud I managed to do it. It was really hard to be honest, and when I try to stand up now I feel like im 95 years old. The terrain was just flat most of the time with a few short climbs (140m in elevation from the whole trip) so it wasn't that challenging but the wind was blowing straight into us for a good portion of time (21km/h - 18km/h) so that slowed us down a bit.

Every time i see him he's in just shorts and flip flops, no matter the weather, on an ancient 3 speed with the shifter missing. He's got a serious belly and a case of beer strapped to his back rack. The road up the hill varies from 6-16%, mostly at around 9%. He rides up that hill like there's no hill, shouting jolly encouragement at the top of his lungs to all the cyclists on road bikes in full kit as he passes them. ""Come on! I'll give you a beer if you beat me to the top."" and ""You've got this! Don't let a silly hill best you!""

What cyclists do you have around who stand out like that? They don't have to be oddballs. Maybe it's a guy who rides 30 miles a day rain or shine. Maybe it's the person who taught you to fix a flat.

1689579938.0,"Is 100km in a day doable for a relative novice with no ""long ride"" experience [Update after the trip]","A few people asked for an update after the trip, so here I am. I did it! 
100km, 800m elevation gain and around 1000m descent, all together around 7h with a few stops (so about 6 or 6.5h on a bike). 
The only really hard part was that most of the uphill happened in the last 25km, and by that point it was already quite hot. In the moment, I hated it, but then the last descent was  totally worth it. 

Thanks again  to everyone who gave me helpful tips for the journey. I lubed the chain before the trip, kept the front basket which was incredibly useful to have, had more than enough water, probably ate too few energy bars, but all in all felt god afterwards.

1617006630.0,My helmet probably saved my life yesterday in an accident without other people involved. Wear your helmet.,"Yesterday I was winding down, a few km's from home after a very windy 75km trip with my covid-19 clique. I am grabbing my water bottle for a quick sip when slowly descending a nearly flat downhill road, not going fast at all. Whilst doing this I am leaving the part of the road that has vegetation on both sides and come into open fields. 

This happens in a split second or two, but leaving the vegetation patch an absolute blast of a sidewind grabs my aero bike with aero wheels. Like someone hit me and my bike with a large pillow. I didn't have the bottle yet so I quickly have my second hand back on my bars but it's too late. I can't stabilise and the oversteering with my sole left hand to the right now has me adjusting strong to the left with both hands and I completely lose control of the bike. The wheel and bar collapses to the left and I go airborne in a spinning flip, landing on the right side of my lower back first and whiplashing my head into the asphalt on the back left side of my skull. This is the first time I really get into a more serious accident and I am now waiting for the absolute horror of pain in my head to start getting through the adrenaline. 

Nothing happens, my mind is clear. Some bypassers are quickly gathering around me asking if I am alright as I take a few breaths while my lower back is hurting bad but I just get up and walk away from the road and go sit on a little sidewalk wall. Inspecting the damage to my bike and shaking my head.

I had one 110km ride a couple of years back, it was on a hybrid bike with a couple of friends also on different non road bike. The ride was horrible, we all made mistakes which resulted in a couple of falls, nothing serious. We also did not properly plan our route and just used google maps which got us lost multiple times and send us on roads where we had to push our bikes. It took us over 10 hours but we made it.

This year I discovered some amazing bike paths close to where I live and this got me back to cycling after a 2 year break ( not counting cycling around the city with my city bike ). I have done a couple of rides between 20 and 50 kilometres ( 12 to 31 miles ). Last ride was 49km in 2hours, this was a mix of gravel roads and nice cycling paths.

So this time I am heading in full gear and better prepared :

1. Going on my road bike
2. Pre-planned a route and I will have a map in front of me with voice turn to turn navigation
3. I have better equipment to make it more comfortable ( bib shorts, jersey, clip on pedals and proper sunglasses this time which stick to the face )
4. Going to have enough water, banana, 1 energy bar and 1 protein bar

&#x200B;

Now my biggest problem usually is pacing myself. I tend to start cycling too fast and dont realize until I am completely out of breath. So tomorrow I really have to watch out for that. I will definitely also need to take some breaks because my back/neck cant survive being on the bike for that long.

So do you lovely people have any suggestions for me? Any advice is welcome, from tips on good snacks for the road up to advice on when to take breaks etc :) Thank you

~~edit: it looks like my ride might not happen. I noticed today that the chain started grinding on the front  derailleur, tried to fix it and messed it up even more. now I am stuck and cant get it to shift normally~~  


edit 2 : I fixed the god damn derailleur. took me 3 hours to figure out how this works and to sort it out. bikes rides much smoother than before now! chain also cleaned and oiled, im ready.",cycling,2020-07-31 13:40:12

Atleast for gravel or even MTB rides you are prepared but on a road bike shitty roads destroy me way more than a rocky trial.

Before every ride I always check out my bike (I do not know what I’m looking for but seems right) and check my tire pressure. Pressure always feels sooo low compared to my father in laws bike. Every ride I pull out my pump and crank that thing as hard as I can and psi always comes up over 100psi. Well that seems like an appropriate psi. I do my ride and I feel like my tires are under inflated but what do I know, I’ve only been doing this for a month. 

Well today after my 28mile ride I google what the possible issues I could be having.  I HAVE TO TWIST OPEN PRESTA VALVES!!! This entire time I’ve been riding on like 35psi.  I went out inflated my tire correctly and rode around the block. What a world of difference.

It's been a great way to keep weight off, make new friends and keep fit. I've taken my bike on so many adventures and been to some amazing places, normally on my own, but just recently made a new friend who comes out for an evening ride with me from time to time. 

I try and cycle 6 days a week for about 30 to 60 minutes. I'm a big guy and have always been verbally abused by passing cars and sometimes pedestrians. I have tried my hardest to ignore them(sticks and stones and all that), but since covid, I have noticed I'm getting a lot more abuse than I did before and it is getting to me.  

I've found myself putting my cycling gear on, going to the shed to get my bike out only to put it back away, as I don't feel up to someone shouting insults at me. 

This week I've had someone call me something fat related every time I've gone out. 

**Update** Thank you so much to all you awesome people who have taken the time to comment and message me. 

I am generally touched by how kind you all have been and did not expect so many comments! I have been out on my bike today with a new view on how to deal with these fools and I'm not going to let them bother me anymore! 

Once again thank you! 


One car for example purposely sped up to insult me as I had just turned off the road and he wanted to get his insult out before I was too far away... I mean why?

I get someone calling me fat insults every time I'm out and last Friday I was very unlucky and got called a fat c*** and then on my way back home I got called faaaatttt by a passing BMW driver that was inches from taking me out.  I imagine the lapse in his driving was the excitement of shouting at a stranger 

My question is to other big cyclists, have you noticed a change since covid and does it get easier? 

I know I'm fat and I am trying, but I just want to ride my bike without fear of someone hurling abuse at me for no reason.",cycling,2022-08-14 21:05:53

&#x200B;

I've been riding on my new bike with disc brakes for over a year after riding with rim brakes for ages. I've honestly thought the improvement is marginal. I thought as long as you have great pads and set your tension correctly, you are gonna have a good time. With the new bike, I could tell I have greater control over my braking, but I could modulate my rim brakes just fine too. Until yesterday.

&#x200B;

Another rider made a left turn in front of me while I was closing in to pass. It's a max braking scenario, rear wheel on air but I could modulate it so well that I also had a chance to steer away while the rear tire was still off the ground. We both saved it and there was no collision, although it was *very* close. I'm positive I couldn't have pulled that off with the paddle brakes.

https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/gg13eg/operation_fat_bd_begins/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

As I mentioned day 2 began after yesterday's rest day.

To answer a few questions about me walking up the first hill instead of cycling and stopping - I actually started strava as I left the house this time and recorded the full route and elevations.
The hill is 510ft in around 0.5 miles directly from my house There's noway I'm cycling that.... Yet. I very rarely see anyone attempt it with a bike. 

So I walked to the top of the hill. Got on with instant regret as the pain in my rear became immediately apparent. Like sitting on a bed of nails. Except all the nails bar two were broken and they were placed neatly, one on each cheek. 

But I carried on.

It was actually harder than the first ride 2 days ago. I had to stop more often (I think). My legs definitely protested more. But I carried on and did it.

3.86 miles,  346ft of elevation gain. 30 mins 46 seconds. This includes the 9 or so mins to walk up the hill. 

Coming down 'the hill' on what is a poor excuse for a tarmac road hurt more than the rest of the ride combined. 

Know that your collective words of wisdom and encouragement were ringing in my ears as I went around. 

""Whatever i do today is better than yesterday's nothing.""

Experienced cyclists can hear you coming in the first place and, although unsettling, they can keep the bike straight. But some new riders may get startled and hurt themselves.

By the same token, leave at least 3 feet distance when passing one. I've been passed way too close when there was no reason for it (no oncoming traffic, straight road, etc).

I ride very close to the shoulder in straight and predictable ways, I pose no threat. When I drive I make sure to give cyclists a wide birth and sometimes I shield them from cars behind in tricky sections.

1. A city bus, as in employed by the damned city I live in, nearly hit me while I was in the bike lane. It came within inches of my leg and I could feel my bike start to get pulled under until I righted myself.
2. During a fast (30 mph+) descent in which I was taking the full lane, I had a person pull out in front of me and immediately put on a right turn signal while slamming on the brakes. I had only two choices, go straight into oncoming traffic and be killed, or skid to a stop behind her. (For those who will ask: this road has ample markings for 'cyclist may use full lane' because it is a SCHOOL zone. PLUS there was construction going on which closed the bike lane so there were big orange flags saying the same thing in even larger font). Even more so, she was already yelling ""I HAD MY BLINKER ON"" out her window AS I was skidding to a stop, like she had it planned ahead of time. Really? You're going to pull some shit like that and then yell at ME?
3. Shortly thereafter, with adrenaline still pumping from before, I signal to take a left onto my street with AMPLE room between me and the car behind me. The car decides to REV UP and get right on my fucking back wheel right before I take the turn. Just to fuck with me I guess?  


What the fuck is wrong with people?

See, I’ve been really frustrated with my lack of career progress, so I’ve been taking classes at the local state university, to try to switch fields.

Anyway, this particular night, the tension was building to a peak. I had just taken an exam that day for a particularly nit picky professor, and was frankly worried about my prospects. So I’m cruising along in the dark, brooding on my dark thoughts, when an alert pops up on my phone (which I use as my cycle computer) from the university’s online app (canvas, if you’re curious). My exam had just been graded, and I’d received literally 0.5% below a C on it. I was so frustrated, all I could think was, “For the love of god, professor, you could have given me the half percent!” So naturally, I explode, and I vented my rage to the world! I yelled, at the top of my lungs, “Just fucking PASS me!”

All of a sudden, from behind me I hear a “Jesus, sorry!” And some guy, who materialized out of nowhere, passes me on his bike.

Here are a few general safety tips for motorists to help keep our roads safe for bicyclists:

• Avoid distractions while driving
• Always stop and look in both directions before turning right on red
• When turning left, look for oncoming bicyclists 
• When approaching an intersection, pay close attention to your surroundings and look for anyone who may be crossing the street
• Use caution and double check your mirrors before making a right-hand turn
• Do not park or drive in bike lanes, if present 
• If you’re parking on a roadway, check your side and rear-view mirrors for bicyclists before opening your door

It's not meant to be witty or humorous and it's by no means complete. If you have anything to add that I feel is worthy, I'll credit you and add it to the list.

I know this sort of thing has been done to death e.g., https://18milesperhour.com/universaltruthsofcycling and their intention is towards humor and irony. Pages such as the Velominatis' ""The Rules"" only apply to a specific cycling sub-culture, whereas I wanted something that applies to ALL cyclists. Subsequently, statements such as ""beer tastes better after a ride"" didn't make the list because while that's true for me, it's not true for my tee-totaling buddy that prefers a post-ride cordial or fruit juice.

**Universal truths of cycling (according to geo_log_88)**

The older guy with the bushy grey beard will always smile and wave at you.

Most drivers are ok but some are actually trying to hurt or kill you.

There's always someone faster than you. 

Wind sucks/blows. (/u/bellendguerre)

If you haven't already, you will fall or crash.

If you haven't already, you will get a flat.

Some days, for absolutely no reason at all, you'll feel like shit and won't enjoy the ride.

Every dollar you spend on cycling is an investment in your mobility and well-being (physical and mental).

Yes, you may be content, but you'll never be 100% satisfied with the bike(s), tools or clothing you currently own.

That one song can be stuck in your head for the entire ride.

I don't even know what to say honestly, the best way I could describe it is that my world has shifted and it will never be the same. The only bikes I've had in the past are 200-dollar crappy hybrid/mountain bikes from Walmart that are hell to pedal even when I first got them. I just picked up a Madone 2.1 used, and......wow. Just wow. I can't believe I have gone this far in life without this. It is almost scary how fast I went when I wasn't even pushing that hard. I am a new man.

1565725196.0,Thanks!,"On Saturday I made a post about my frustration as an overweight new cyclist with not being faster and had said that my goal was to be able to maintain 17mph to ride in a local no drop ride.

I received tons of confidence boosters along with loads of good advice. The training continues, but Sunday I washed my bike, lubed my chain and bought a pair of bibs. Then I went out and maintained 17mph over 15 miles, something I didn’t think I was ready for quite yet. I’m sure I looked ridiculous and I’m also sure that the confidence boost made a much bigger change than the bibs or bike maintenance.

I’ve been a part of some hobby and fitness subs that can be toxic or elitist or hard for beginners to ask for advice without being told to leave it to the pros. I’m psyched that I didn’t get that here and I just wanted to say thanks.

1689084800.0,"Calling a bicycle ""accoustic"" is cringe inducing. Please stop.","I never correct people here who ask about their peddle cadence, or who need help with their breaks. Spelling mistakes are unintentional.

But to purposely add a non-sensical word to ""bicycle"" is a douchey attempt at being clever. Do you even know what ""acoustic"" means?

Edit: Well I fucked up. Just wanted to vent a little, even though that term was only used a few times. But now it's benefitted from the Streisand effect. If I really cared enough, I'd delete this. But considering how many people this post annoys, I'll leave it up.

Edit 2: For those commenting on spelling, I can't believe people here think my misspelling of ""peddle"" and ""breaks"" wasn't intended. I thought of putting quotations around those words, but figured people aren't that clueless.  [Fuck me, I'm still getting comments citing to this specific edit claiming I'm just covering up for my ironically bad spelling. How can people not read for context?

1596014203.0,KONA CATASTROPHIC FAILURE,"Hi Everyone.

My 2010 (edited date) Jake the Snake suffered a catastrophic failure about 2.5 months ago. I was doing about 40mph down a steep road and when I hit the breaks the aluminium steering tube coupling snapped (edit: uploaded Image: [https://imgur.com/k10Gpce](https://imgur.com/k10Gpce)), the coupling connects the aluminium steering tube to the carbon forks. The accident wasn't pretty to say the least, and I am very lucky to be here today.

My bike has been used for  3-4 years as a commuter and has then spent the rest of it's life in the garage. I started using it recently on some gentle gravel tracks and it has never had a major accident.

The accident is one thing. (2.5 months and recovery still ongoing). But the complete lack of interest from Kona is another. I contacted them 2 months ago to try and understand what had happened, whether this type of thing had happened to the model before etc and they have pretty much ignored every attempt that I have made to contact.

This led me to do some research and I found this [LINK](https://www.bicyclenetwork.com.au/newsroom/2019/02/28/fork-fail-leads-to-death/) about recommendations made in Australia about fork failure leading to a coroner ordering changes of wording in owners manuals in 2015... no changes seem to have been made outside of AUS.

Has anyone else had a similar problem with a Kona Bike? Has anyone had a similar terrible customer service experience from Kona? I feel Kona should at least be interested in the accident and try to understand what happened, and that their lack of interest is not just bad customer service but also reckless with regards to the safety of others with the same bike.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this matter. Should Kona take interest with a view to adding warnings on critical bike components that might fail over time per the example in Australia?

Thanks

1701197857.0,[Update from last week's post] what the heck happened to me? Well....,"You may have recalled seeing [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/17zbjaf/what_the_heck_happened_to_me_today/) last Sunday, where I had some concerning symptoms after an intense indoor training ride. Most of the symptoms seemed to resemble that of a ""bonk"", so I just kind of brushed them off. 

Well, the symptoms persisted throughout the following day and even got worse. At night, I started to get mild chest tightness. I tried to make it through to the morning, but I just couldn't, and at 3 am  I woke up with stabbing chest pains so I drove myself to the ER. They hooked me up to an EKG and the doctor's faces told me all I needed to know - I was having a heart attack. I was immediately rushed to the cath lab to fix a 100% blockage of a heart artery and needed multiple stents. I was in the hospital for 2 days and was discharged on Thanksgiving, and have been home resting & recovering ever since. I'm feeling better every day, going on walks and whatnot, but it's going to be a long time before I'm on the bike again. I'll likely have to do some cardiac rehab as well.

Oh, did I mention that I am 33 years old? I always knew I had cardiac issues in my family but I never expected them to hit me at this age, especially given my active lifestyle. Just so fucking unfortunate. 

I'm thankful that I went to the ER when I did and avoided what could have been a catastrophic situation, and that the doctors intervened before I caused any real damage to my heart.

 So I stopped did some stretches thinking that it would make my shoulder pain go away, but it didn’t it.
When I start riding it got 10x worst my heart and lungs felt compressed and I wasn’t able to go any faster than 3km/h so I decided call my mother to pick me up 2 km away and go back to the main road that was a couple hundred meters away.
The pain got even worst after 200m I couldn’t ride anymore, so I started walking very slowly, but after a few meters it felt impossible to even walk so I stopped and looked around to think of my options. When suddenly a random driver that was parked behind came to my side and asked me if everything was ok. So I explained to him that I wasn’t feeling very well so he took me to where my mom was (he had a little van so my bike went in the back). A lot of others cars had passed trough me but no one stopped you could literally see in my face that I was feeling like shit. If it wasn’t for that man, I really don’t know what would have happened.
After reaching my mother I put my bike in our car and went flying to the hospital.
At the hospital I did some exams, and supposedly everything is fine.
I will be resting the next couple days do that I can go back training.

1633801836.0,Cycling continues to bring me new and strange experiences: A deer peed on me today.,"My ride this morning was one I won't soon forget.

I was going downhill at about 32mph. Maybe 15 feet in front of me I see a young deer step into the road on the right. He sees me and of course takes off full speed directly at me. Time feels like it slows down. Not much I can do, brake a bit and drift left; I start mentality preparing for the crash.  The deer gets about 2 feet in front me jukes back right, jumps, does a backflip, and lets it bladder go. I then have my most surreal cycling experience yet: riding through an arch of deer urine with a deer about 6 feet off the ground, upside down, a few itches to my right as I fly past. As I sit and write this a few hours later I'm still in shock that I didn't crash. I may buy a lottery ticket today.

1610235226.0,Why do cyclists do this?,"So this is something that happens occasionally. But the same guy did it three times in a row today and it just baffled me. 

Basically, I was on an endurance ride and riding really steadily at 185W in a fairly narrow bike lane (call it 18mph at the time). The guy in front of me was going maybe 14mph, I passed him, and kept riding. 

I then hit a red light about a quarter mile later. I stopped, the other guy stopped to my left a minute later. He pushes off before the light even turns green and basically sprints to get in front of me. Then starts riding at 14mph again, I pass him again. 

Repeat at TWO MORE LIGHTS! Can anyone explain the reasoning for this? Why not just wait the half second after the light turns green for me to get ahead of him since I was riding at a faster pace, instead of sprinting ahead knowing I’d just be passing him again? Especially on a fairly busy road where I had to wait for an opening to pass. 

On the spectrum of things that frustrate me while cycling, this one was pretty low on the list. But it utterly confounded me and I’m curious if anyone else regularly experiences the same (it actually happens somewhat frequently, just never three times in a row) or has some insight as to why people do this.

1592520556.0,"Just went for my first ""big"" cycle. Some thoughts.","It was 32 miles. I know that's real small fry for a lot of you, but it's big for me. All in all, I'd say I definitely enjoyed it. This is what I drew from it:

* Headwinds are the devil's anus. They're just the worst. I hate them with a passion. The last 15 miles or so was with a near constant headwind, and holy crap was it bad. I stopped more in that last leg than I've ever had to before. I was having to pedal on the downhills at some bits, and I was having to take a break at the end of nearly ever uphill.
* My area is not an easy place to cycle. There are hills *everywhere.* And if there aren't hills, there are gentle inclines. It definitely makes it more interesting, but good god is it not fun after a while. I don't think I got above 3rd the entire ride.
* Indexing your gears is one if the single best things you can do to improve your riding experience. It took me all of 10 minutes, and I went from gear changes that lasted 5 seconds and culminated in a huge ""KA-CHUNK"" to a ""click"". Oh, and I got my 3rd and 5th gears back, coz the derailleur was just skipping over them.
* I should have listened to my mother and put sunscreen on.
* Going downhill on long, steep gravel paths is one of the most fun things you can do on a bike. I seriously feel sorry that people who have only ever had road bikes haven't experienced it.
* Make sure everything on your bike is fine. My pedals were making a creaking noise the whole time, and holy hell was it annoying. I'll be trying to fix it tomorrow, don't worry.

Most of all, I realised my own limits. Around the 20-25 mile mark, I started to seriously struggle. It wasn't even because i was too sore in my legs or anything, it was like I had just completely ran out of energy. But, I look forward to my next ""big"" cycle.

1657508168.0,Don't be an audiophile,"Here's a little teaser for those who never ventured into the maddening realm of audiophilia. Gold cables, audio-grade wifi routers, audio-grade power bricks, and power filters made out of amber to make it sound more refined. All starting as low as couple thousand bucks.

Every bike equipment review on youtube has a mandatory segment including a kitchen scale, and everyone is obsessed with weight. It's a neverending race for the lightest bike one can obtain. While it can convenient - especially if you have to haul your bike from your apartment on every ride - we have to remember that ultimately what matters is the whole system's weight. That means the bike and the rider weight combined. For an average weekend warrior saving 100 grams from upgrading from Ultegra to DuraAce for example, will save a second on an hour-long trip. Buying a fancy set of carbon wheels is equivalent to riding with one water bottle instead of two.

1620401753.0,"I had to sell my bike today, and I couldn't even be there to say goodbye to it 😔","Long story. I don't really have anyone around to share this story with who hasn't already been following it from the beginning, and no fellow cyclist friends nearby, so I figured Reddit would be a good place.

I am from the US but have never envisioned a future for myself here. I've spent more years of my adult life living long-term outside of the US than inside it. In 2017, I had returned to the US from a work experience in India that went a bit sour and, being a bit at a loss as to what to do next, I bought a one-way ticket to Malaysia.

I had my first experience cycling as an adult in Southern Thailand, where, on a whim, I signed up for a week-long organized cycling tour. That was a great experience (well, minus the tumble from braking too hard on a descent, which left me with a shoulder impingement that lingered for months). A few months after that, I arrived in Vietnam for the first time and fell in love with the country.

I ended up staying for the better part of four years. Over that time, I fell in love with cycling. It all started when I decided to see if I could take the city bike I was riding at the time over the longest bridge in the city. Cycling was the first form of physical activity that I actually enjoyed, and I became more and more serious about riding and training over those four years. I also created a life and livelihood for myself from scratch, working a remote job that freed me from the rat race and gave me plenty of time to cycle. The bike was a vehicle for fitness, daily transportation, and epic adventures. I saw the jungle, the mountains, the beach, and the city on a nearly daily basis. Life was vibrant.

In August 2019, I rode my first imperial century, and quite a hilly one at that. After 1.5 years on a Giant Escape City, that was the ride where my hands, wrists, lower back, and neck told me it was time to upgrade. So I did. My parents got me a 2019 Trek 520 for my birthday. A couple weeks later, I re-rode the same century ride on the new bike, a half hour faster, and much more comfortably 😄

That bike, as all our bikes are, was my pride and joy. I got the silver one and got everything to match in silver and blue. On a trip back to the US later that year I even got some blue Catalyst pedals to really top off the color scheme. My Trek 520 was my companion for thousands of kms and during some of the most memorable experiences (bike tours) of my life. (Not to say that my previous bike didn't also give me some stellar experiences!)

Then 2020 happened—a year in which, obviously, everyone worldwide rode less. 2020 was a massive year of inactivity for me even beyond that, though. After enduring two lockdowns, prohibitive summer humidity, and even a period when people were not allowed to go out on bicycles for any reason (bicycles were being seized and/or riders fined, even for commuting), I was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor in September after having a seizure. It's good that I never had one while riding on my bicycle or on the back of someone else's motorbike.

The sole American doctor in the city advised me to go back to the US, as adequate neurosurgery is just not available in Vietnam yet. Putting aside the aspect of after-care, Thailand, India, and Singapore would have been possible candidates too, if it had not been for the pandemic. With Vietnam's borders being closed by then, my only option was really to leave my life in Vietnam behind indefinitely, and since everything was so urgent, I had to leave my stuff with friends. Thankfully one German cyclist friend of mine agreed to store the bike for me as long as he could, and one of his local friends did the same with my other belongings.

When I say ""back to the US,"" I mean to my parents' place in suburban Florida. I grew up in Michigan, but after I finished high school, my parents retired and moved down here. I don't know anyone here and the median age is among the highest in the entire country. This place is extremely boring and not very conducive to outdoor activities. The couple weeks spent sitting around waiting for something to move forward with my treatment felt like an eternity. I couldn't even cook for myself lest I injure myself in the kitchen (and there was nothing I wanted more than all that delicious Vietnamese street food).

Surgery was fine. The doctor said it was in his top 20 biggest brain tumors ever. The days and nights in the ICU and the hospital after that weren't very pleasant. I had to keep taking steroids for a few months after that, which was one of the worst experiences of my life, along with having to completely avoid bending down/physical exertion/straining. I don't want to write too much about it because recovering from brain surgery isn't as arduous as you would think (you don't need any sort of PT or cognitive rehab, etc.), and this story is about my bike, anyway.

...which my German friend contacted me about a few days ago, saying that his landlord's uncle was interested. But being a typical Vietnamese uncle, not knowing anything about ""real"" bikes, he gave a really lowball offer. Like, insultingly low. It had been stored indoors for the most part since I left, but apparently (and my friend forget to tell me) a cafe was opened on the ground floor, and because they needed the space, my bike was moved outside (covered, but still, it's humid). The uncle complained that my asking price was too high because the bike had been left out too long—not that that's anything me or my friend had any control over.

Anyway, after thinking it over for a couple days, I decided to take that lowball offer. Two of Vietnam's major cities have just gone on some form of lockdown *again*, so while it would have already been hard to coordinate a sale remotely and not even knowing the condition of the bike in detail, now it's virtually impossible to organize anything, even if I wanted to try selling it back to the shop (which is in a different city). And with Vietnam's approach to the pandemic, the likely date for the borders reopening is probably now sometime in the very distant future.

I've resigned to giving up cycling for the foreseeable future. It's the thing that gave me the most enjoyment in life, but it's very location-dependent. Here where I am, it's too dangerous to ride (it was declared the most dangerous county in the US for cyclists and pedestrians), and the scenery just consists of Wal-Marts and parking lots anyway. I started running (and actually enjoying it), but a bout of extensor tendonitis (or tenosynovitis, perhaps) has kept me house-bound for almost two weeks now.

I am thinking about relocating to Georgia (the country) as I've had friends say good things about it, and I know someone there right now. However, it doesn't seem like a good fit for cycling. It would mostly just be to experience independent life in an urban setting again, be able to make some money and still have free time, and maybe have some social interaction with people my age. But I suppose that's the most I can expect from life anymore at this point.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading and caring about this particular life story.",cycling,2021-05-07 15:35:53
1618408443.0,"New Bike Day, to Bad Day","Yesterday, I finally treated myself to the new bike that I had been saving up to purchase for several years. A Giant TCR Advanced Pro 1. The moment I get home from the bike shop, I gear up, throw some pedals on the bike, and grab a friend to take it on a shakedown ride around some local hills.

We're both feeling great, the bike is feeling amazing, it's stiff, responsive, and an all-around pleasure to ride. As we are descending on a hill, my friend takes the lead, and I follow, about 5m behind. Unbeknownst to us, there is some gravel that was washed onto this road by a storm that occurred over the weekend. He washes out, and as I am unable to avoid him laying across the road, I go over the top of the bars. As we get up, I look at my brand-new bike.

Both shift levers are trashed, and I scuffed the rear chainstay badly. His bike is banged up as well (badly scratched wheels)  and we both have some minor road-rash.

TLDR: Friendships can handle a lot -- but wrecking on your new bike puts a hell of a strain on one. ;) 

(Edit: This is meant to be tongue in cheek, he and I are still friends and were laughing about it this morning, but the emotional anguish of wrecking two new carbon bikes was a lot at the time.)",cycling,2021-04-14 13:54:03

I clean and lube my drivetrain at least once a month, or whenever it gets really dirty during a ride. Even more so now during these colder, wetter months. It keeps it feeling great, after a clean and lube it feels like a brand new bike, it is amazing! Not only that it prolongs the life of the components.

1702501341.0,Driver charged with vehicular homicide in Magnus White's death,"It's been 5 long months, but they're finally pressing charges against the driver who killed Magnus White earlier this year. Magnus was a cyclist with the U.S. National Team, and was on a training ride when he was struck from behind by a car that was likely traveling 50-60mph. He was 17 at the time.

This happened in broad daylight, on a road with a 10-foot shoulder (a road I've ridden many times myself). Our city is planning to build a dedicated bike path along this route, to avoid tragedies like this from occurring again. In the meantime, I hope these charges make it clear to drivers that *you cannot get away with killing someone*, even if you do it in a car. Link to the article is here:

Following his death, Magnus' family started a nonprofit organization called **The White Line**, which aims to increase safety for cyclists on the road by advocating for better infrastructure. They're also making *Lives Worth Remembering*, a series of films paying tribute to riders who have been killed. You can view and contribute to their work here:

1606950491.0,Ride safely please! Don't put your life to risk when riding (Realised after a terrible crash),"Hi r/cycling 

6 months back I took up riding just to lose some weight and get fit. Really liked and enjoyed it and even lost almost 20kgs of this fat and now my thighs look very tight and toned and everything.

2.5 months back after reading about road bikes got one for myself and I was simply thrilled with the adrenaline rush you get when you ride it faster and faster on the drops. Started to watch all the GCN videos along with this channel called Lantern Rouge(not a promotion but do check him out he really made watching all the cycling tours and tactics so interesting to an absolute amateur like me).

And being the dumb 20 year old I am I started to try and imitate the professionals from the races(think going too fast without realising that unlike them I don't get to have clear roads,personal crew and stuff).Initially it was great with me riding around 60-70 kms everyday with an average speed somewhere around 37-38 kms per hour. Until today evening.

I was in the middle of a descent going around 55 kms an hour on the drops and trying to push even harder(I know it's very stupid but I just wanted to get faster!) and out of nowhere this car comes and bam!

I go sliding on the tarmac with my bike and almost go blank for couple of seconds. Moments later see my left side of the body is pretty much bleeding everywhere below the shoulder right till the ankle. 

Long story short I am lying on the bed right now with thankfully no serious life threatening injury just bruises pretty much covering all over my left side. The painkiller is slowly wearing off and I can feel the burning sensation from all the bruises when I pretty much got grated against the road surface. Only knew how bad it was when I checked my white cycling jersey I used to wear its all bloody and literally torn from everywhere!

Trust me it's not pretty and it hurts soooo bad. I don't think I'll be working out anytime soon and girlfriend has already told me you aren't touching that road bike again.

So please please please ride safely don't go too fast(don't even try stuff they show on YouTube with crazy speeds at turns and descents) or you'll learn it the hard way like me. This subreddit has really been helpful to me(even though I was more of a silent reader and Upvoter here) but I think this is the best way I would like to return the favour. Stay safe everyone and keep riding!

I came in with a bit too much speed and the bike slid out from under me, causing my head to bounce off of the pavement. Luckily a fellow cyclist behind me stopped and made sure I was okay. After a few minutes of getting my bearings back I hopped back on the bike and rode back to my car (I know this may not have been the best idea, but I don't know anyone in this city).

So after riding about 30 miles back to my car I take myself to the nearest urgent care. The doctor there was beyond elated when she found out I was wearing my helmet. She was going on and on about how the crack in my helmet could've been a crack in my skull and how they see people come in who aren't wearing helmets and aren't as fortunate as myself.

On my ride today I got hit for the first time by an old lady in a BMW while crossing the street on a green light in a bike crossing. Only lightly scraped up and bike is fine as it was more of a sideswipe, but a bit shaken up. 

As I was approaching the crossing with 20 seconds left on the light, a cyclist coming the other way waved through a BMW waiting to turn right. BMW didn’t look to see if it was clear to go, turning out right in front of me and giving me mere feet to try to stop. I obviously couldn’t stop in time, banging into the side of their car and getting scraped a bit on their door. Me being careful and anticipating what could go wrong at that crossing possibly saved me from a much worse collision. 

PSA to other cyclists, and even motorists: do not wave through cars that don’t have the right of way. They will usually not verify that it’s safe to go, leading to dangerous situations. This is called the “wave of death” for a reason.",cycling,2022-06-29 22:12:22

He stayed on his bike the whole time and I tried to talk to him through my window. I asked if he was ok and if he wanted me to pull over and give him my details, but he just said no no he was fine and continued away. I believe it was mainly his front tyre that hit my car and his palm on my bonnet to stop himself.

After I had fully recovered, I began 7 weeks of Cardiac Rehabilitation, which involved going to the gym at my local hospital 2 days a week (Mondays and Thursdays, 2 1-hour sessions). Before that started, I made a goal to run, because I had never been fit enough to do so previously, as I had multiple heart infections that caused a significant of time in and out of hospital in my early-mid teen years. Anyway, 6 open-heart surgeries later, and I'm a new man. 

I began running during quarantine basically daily, then decided to go for a ride late last week. I did, and managed to ride for 2 hours straight, stopping once for a brief moment at a rather steep uphill, because there was a massive headwind slowing me down, and I had to catch my breath for a moment. 

Then, 2 days ago, I decided to ride again, this time along a rail trail (an old train line connecting 3 local towns together, my hometown being in the middle). 
I rode along that trail for about an hour, reaching the sign that said the next station was 4km away, (meaning I had reached the next town over, yay!), before stopping for a brief second, turning around and coming back. 

It was a 32km ride in ~2 hours, and I felt completely fine when I arrived back home (except for my quads feeling very sore the next day).

*********

Today I into a (heated, but friendly) debate with my dad over cycling. He is not quite a professional roadracer, but he has definitely done his fair share of cycling over the years. On the other hand I’m just a 20 year old kid who has been biking around 10 miles to and from school since age 8.

Anyways we ended up discussing the difficulty of biking 100 miles (to which my dad said there was no way I could pull that off).

So naturally we put 300 dollars on the line and tomorrow im gonna attempt exactly this. So my question is now:

1. How screwed am I?

2. Is there anything I can do to prepare for this until tomorrow morning?

I’m gonna borrow some bike pants from him and I plan to bring water, 2 sandwiches, caffein and some sugar, besides the equipment incase of a puncture.

Not the biggest deal in the world as one can do worse things (see my other post from today for an example).

However, I feel like many people forget how inappropriate honking really is. It can cause a wreck between cars even, and worse so on a bike. Its not a muffled beep like it is from your vehicle, its a defeaning and unexpected intrusion that foretells an impending accident. We are already on edge watching cars as they pass us, and I myself take a horn as a sign to look for oncoming danger. Cyclists, don't be afraid to gently ask people not to do this, as the gentleman who did it to me thought it was funny.

This road, one lane is parking lot heading east in the morning, and vice versa in the afternoon. There are no alternative routes, and there is a large school that you can't drive around. I have taken this route during rush hour in a vehicle and it adds 15-20 minutes.

There is a shoulder for bikes. Enough room to ride 20-25km/h safely.

That is, until a driver sitting in the long line of traffic gets mad and advances and turns sharply and suddenly so the front of their car blocks the shoulder. Thankfully there is enough room to dodge but it is incredibly unsafe and it happens 2-3 times each commute. Makes me want to spend the $ to get a bike camera.

1639370604.0,Husband thinks I’m being selfish for cycling on weekends,"I’ve gotten into group cycling this last year and I really love it. I’ve met some nice people, and have had such an amazing time getting to know the terrain here (I’m in the SF Bay Area. A long steep descent through the redwoods - just such a thrill! I’ve always been active but generally the things I would do (running, yoga, going to the gym) would take 1 to 2 hours at most. These group rides are often 40-50 miles with a stop for lunch in between and can take 5 hours including the drive to and from the meeting point, so I’ll leave at 8 and be back around 1 or 2 for example. 

We have two teenagers and a two year old. So when I’m gone, he has to deal with the kids. I work m-f so I’ve been going one weekend day. Not every weekend, but maybe 2-3 weekend days a month. When I go, I watch the toddler for the entire other weekend day (so either Saturday or Sunday) so my husband can do whatever he wants. 

We just had a big fight because he thinks it’s too much time for me to be gone and it puts too much pressure on him. He usually uses his “free day” to do random errands, home repairs, and stuff like that, nothing fun. He also is guilt tripping me and saying that it’s selfish and “ridiculous” to be away from the family that much. I seriously want to cry right now because I just love it so much and I was hoping to work up to doing a century 100 mile ride in March. Which would of course take the whole day. He’s sedentary, doesn’t exercise, and is a bit of a workaholic and chronically stressed out. We usually get along, but are very different in this respect and I feel like he doesn’t understand and totally doesn’t support me. 

I realize this is more of a relationship question than a cycling question. Just wondering if he’s out of line, if I am, or if anyone deals with this dynamic in their relationship (especially people with kids) and how you handle it. 

TL/DR: My husband watches our kids while I go on long rides 2-3 times a month and wants me to stop because it’s too much time away from the family.

** Edit: Thanks all for the comments and suggestions!  Seems like a lot of people can relate.  We talked about it again this morning after we both slept on it and I'm going to cut back to a max of two weekend rides a month, starting very early in the morning so I'm back before noon.  I also have a ton of banked vacation days at work so I'm going to use a day here and there to get a long ride in during the week while he's at work and the kids are at school/daycare.  He does want to be supportive, but feels overwhelmed dealing with the toddler and all the things that need to happen on the weekend, which I totally understand.  I'm also going to make an extra effort to make sure he also has free time and the mental space to use it to recharge and relax, and not just use that time to be productive.

I was honestly so confused and taken aback my instant response was just “oh fuck off”. The driver the replied “fuck off??? You’re a fucking cunt!!!” then proceeded to throw a rock at me. Luckily he missed.

I spent the entire duration of the remaining 13 miles of my ride worried that this maniac was going to appear behind me and run me off the road. What a horrible bastard.

1683506366.0,Bike tires are… overpriced.,"Rant:

So, bike tire prices are ridiculous.

Exhibit A:

Continental GP5000 line: prices from 88$ to 120$ per tire. 

Continental tires for a Subaru WRX car: prices from 125$ to 220$ per tire. 

Feels to me like there’s much much more rubber on a car tire; you can’t fold a car tire and put it in your pocket. 

From a raw materials perspective, a bike tire thus shouldn’t cost more than 20$ :P

Especially since you’ll buy 10 bike tires for the life of 1 car tire (3,000 miles vs 30,000 miles thread life).

I’m amazed that curent prices are sustained. Who normalized the pricing of a bike tire being the same as a car tire :P

(Yes, I know I can buy cheaper bike tires than the GP5000, but likewise I can buy cheaper car tires as well. But since Continental makes both I used them in my example)

Edit:

Feels like I need to add this addendum: my point is about all bike tires, not the GP5000 exclusively. I just used them as an example. Continental, Schwalble, Panaracer, Vittoria, all the big names have expensive tires, from road to gravel to MTB. It seems the average price of a tire is about 50-100$ each. 

The only truly affordable ones are Chinese tires or if you manage to find some super deal on the big brand ones with coupons or something.",cycling,2023-05-08 00:39:26

1706272287.0,"Go get that bike, not that status.","G'day reddit, I wanted to share a story about my own experiences with riding.

About 5 years ago I got into road cycling. When I bought my first bike I went through FB market place and found aluminum road bike with rim breaks and a lightweight frame. It cost me $600(AU). I told myself ""I will use this cheap bike to just get started and upgrade in 6 months."" I was very self conscious at the start riding a ""cheap"" bike and also felt very intimidated by other with more gear and more experience. I always thought people would look and laugh. Cycling is known for its status I thought. I was slowly putting money aside to upgrade this bike. In my head I thought a $5000 is what I would need for people to take me seriously. I loved my commute to and from work and long solo rides on the weekend as I had no riding buddies at this point. Fast forward 6 months, I was really into my new found sport, all my extra time was spent on my bike. I decided to hold onto my ""cheap"" bike a little longer. I entered into a local race on this bike and that was extremely intimidating and was my first hit out in a competition. It was a 115km road race. At the start line with a few hundred contestant, the MC for the race was walking around asking people how much their bikes were worth. It really annoyed me because my bikes value wasn't the reason I had entered into this event, it was because I was genuinely falling in love with this sport. Anyway with that bad taste in my mouth we set off. I loved every second of that race, even the 12% climb at the end. 

Fast forward another 12 months I had competed in local crits, a 160km gran fondo and an olympic distance triathlon. I did not win any of these races, but I was also far from last (apart from the swim leg on the tri, story for another time.) With how much time I was spending on the bike my wife gave me the green light to go and drop some cash on a new bike. She gave me a budget, and I won't say what it was, but it was extremely generous. The day before I went shopping, I went for a ride, nothing crazy just my favorite 40km loop near my house, and I was sad. I was about to sell this bike that I have made so many memories on. I had grown truly attached to my $600 marketplace steal. Next day I went and tried the bike I was looking at online, took it for a ride and was impressed by how well it felt and handled. But something felt missing. It just felt like a thing. It didn't feel like my bike.

 I found my perceptions of the sport to be very wrong. To think people will judge you for riding something cheap or older was not true. That a good bike makes you good is not true. That you need to drop thousands of dollars to be a part of is not true. I still have this secondhand MP bike and I can confidently say that it will not be gone anytime soon. 

I have found the cycling community to be very welcoming, and people with these higher end bikes truly just enjoyed being out there. They don't care what you ride, they care that you are out there having fun. The people who care about the status usually seem to be the first dropped on the group ride, who would have thought?

My message is this, no matter the budget, whatever you can afford, a lot or a little, go and get that bike and make those memories. It is not about the status, it's about being out there.",cycling,2024-01-26 12:31:27

1696099540.0,The most dangerous drivers are 70+ years old,"I have decided that the most dangerous drivers for cyclists to encounter are 70+. Today I was riding on a one way neighborhood street (going about 18mph in a 25 zone) and a car began to tail gate and honk at me aggressively. i thought there was some kind of emergency he was warning me about. I stopped off to the side and he pulls up and yells that i should be on the sidewalk (there was no sidewalk) and began to drive towards me as he drove away within inches hitting my left leg. So i keep riding and stop behind him at a red light about 40 yards a up the road. at the red light he opened his door and stuck his head out and screamed “PRICK” at me and i said “it’s a neighborhood road and i am legally entitled to the whole lane”. He flipped me off and sped away. A cop this pulls up behind me and says “don’t antagonize him he’s an old man. Just get out of the way” I yelled back that he tried to hit me with his car so the cop replied “look he’s in a car and could kill you just get out of the way. I was mind blown.


 Each and every time I have gotten into a conflict with a driver they are always 70+ and have absolutely no regard for the lives of others. I was hit by an elderly woman in 2015.

1589068165.0,"Bike shop mechanics, what are the weirdest or worst bike mods a customer has asked you to do?","This is a secondhand story, but one of my buddies is a longtime bike mechanic in his city's main LBS and last night he told me the story of a mom who took in her daughter's bike and wanted to have some ""safety"" modifications done to it, because apparently she had recently fallen off and scraped her arm.

Only problem was that she wasn't bringing in a Huffy or anything like that—she had brought in an expensive Liv carbon fiber, aero, Ultegra-equipped road bike. This overly concerned mother said her daughter, who she said was 17, had saved up money from her part-time job to buy it, said that she was riding it ""like a maniac,"" and was concerned for her safety.

So, because of the aforementioned very mild accident, this overly concerned mother was determined to make her daughter’s bike “safer,” and made a lot of… *interesting* demands to say the least in the way of ""safety features,"" so many in fact that she came in with an actual paper list to remember them all:

* She wanted to get rid of the drop bars and replace them with flats, because she said the drop bars would give her daughter ""spine damage."" She also said that the drop bars encouraged ""dangerous behavior.""

* She wanted the tires replaced with massive hybrid tires that the bike wouldn't have had clearance for anyway. She thought the tires already on there were too skinny and were disasters waiting to happen.

* She wanted the clipless pedals replaced with flats, because she was concerned that the clipless pedals might give her daughter ""balance problems."" She didn't elaborate.

* She wanted to add on a ton of reflectors.

* She wanted the saddle replaced with a plushy cruiser seat that she actually brought in with her, obviously bought at Walmart or Target. She said she kept asking her daughter to replace the racing saddle on there with this plushy cruiser one, but she kept saying no. Bizarrely, this mom said she was concerned the racing saddle would shrink the size of her daughter's butt. Seriously… someone's mother said this about their daughter with complete seriousness.

* She wanted to install a ""built in light system."" That, alongside the aforementioned reflectors.

* She wanted to install a GPS tracker, but didn't state her motives for it.

* She wanted to install a chain guard, because she was concerned the chain would hit her daughter's legs and rub skin off.

* She wanted to bolt down the seatpost way lower than what her daughter had it set at. She specifically said she wanted it *bolted down.*

* There was more, but my friend didn't remember everything.

Of course, many of these requests would be very expensive to carry out, or completely impossible. She wasn't having it when my buddy tried to explain that some of what she was asking for was impossible, so instead my buddy quoted her for the things that *were* possible. Of course, she exclaimed that the cost was too high and accused him of trying to rip her off. She left and that was the last he saw of her.

Thankfully, the fate of the bike is known, since the daughter actually brought it in a few months later to replace a broken spoke, and the bike was unchanged since her mother brought it in, and was well taken care of too. Apparently she occasionally showed up for shop group rides until she moved to go to college.

I can't imagine this is an isolated incident, and similar strange or impossible demands have been made of other bike shop mechanics out there. What's the weirdest? What's the worst? I want to hear your tales.",cycling,2020-05-09 23:49:25

I’m new to riding and starting to head into the wetter/colder months. I picked up cycling for fitness so wanted to keep the momentum going and not drop the habit. 

3 weeks ago I picked up a smart trainer and have been having a bunch of fun slowly getting around on Zwift. I had a bit of time in my day before work so decided to go on a quick ride and beat a previous PR I’d set on a course.

1633984849.0,"DA""s pdate on six cyclists hit in Waller County","From the District Attorney's Facebook account:

It has been 16 days now since six innocent bicyclists were run over by a motorist in Waller County.   This office tried to refrain from passing any judgment until we could gather information about what happened at the scene.   As previously stated, we did not get professionally or formally notified of the occurrence at the time of the event, but found out via social media.   Now, we are able to share a small part of our opinions as the case investigation progresses and questions continue to arise as to how the D.A.’s office will proceed.

1)   This case was not handled appropriately by the investigating agency.   PERIOD.  Despite being encouraged by the Texas Department of Public Safety to treat the scene as a crime scene and to contact the D.A.‘s Office for advice on how to proceed, the investigating agency chose not to do so.   The actions of the Texas Department of Public Safety on scene were professional and we are thankful they were there to assist.   We are also working with the Waller County Sheriff’s Office to gather the evidence they are able to provide as they arrived on scene to backup Waller P.D.   Sheriff Guidry has been most helpful in this regard.

2)  There has been some online and community speculation that the incident was handled in the manner it was because of connections between the motorist and Waller city officials.    At this point we can confirm there are some connections, but have yet to see evidence of a city official directing the officer on the scene as to how to handle this particular situation.   We will continue to look for any such criminal interference as the investigation proceeds.

3)   Attorneys for the victims have been more than helpful in assisting this office with seeking justice.    Our lines of communication are open and the victims questions are being answered as they arise even though we know they would prefer a faster decision-making process.

4).  All sides of this matter (the juvenile, the adult passenger, their families, the victims and their friends/families) can be assured that this case is not being swept away as the days pass, and attorneys for both boys are being cooperative at this time.   This will not be a lynching and likewise it will not be a case of small county politics making problems just go away.

5)   Finally, we ask that all of our community members and bicyclists that come here to continue to be respectful of one another, share the roads and abide by the laws.   This is not the time for finger pointing at groups or making assumptions about people based on their choices in sports or residency.    The world is already filled with too much hate and we can do our part as a community (that includes its cyclists and farmers alike) to ensure that justice is done in the courtroom and not on the side of the road.   The world is watching all of us.    Let’s be the example that it needs to see.   

Thanks to all of you for your continued patience.

don't know if this is relevant enough for an update but here it is anyways

firstly, im 16m for those wondering.

I ended re-assessing the route and realized I don't have to go on the highway at all, i only have to cross the highway twice. here's my [shitty diagram](https://imgur.com/a/xvkmF4p).

after a bit of an argument, my parents to let me do it once

the slow road was surprisingly very empty of cars and I made my way to school with ease, with the only problem being almost hitting the wall(not literally) because the entire way is on an incline.

i told my parents it was easy, and  now I've been cycling to school the last two weeks, only taking an uber if I'm late

yeah, I hope this kickstarts my cycling hobby, I've already noticed huge stamina improvements on inclines and I don't get close to hitting the wall as much now

A motorist performed a really shitty overtake on Friday, and as I was already stressed out by the twenty previous shitty overtakes, I lost my temper a bit and gave him the finger.

A few hundred metres down the road, he stopped to pick someone up. Shouted abuse out the window as I passed, and I gave a little back. Stupid I know.

A minute later he passed me again, even closer this time (I guess that's what people call a punishment pass?), and slowed down to shout more shit out the window, with his two mates helping him out.

Unfortunately, this car passes me every day on the way to work. They always pass a little closer than I'd like. You start to remember the ones that do. I'm sure from now on they'll be doing it even worse, and deliberately, so I'm at even more risk.

I'm actually considering stopping at that pick-up point (I think they stop there daily) and trying to apologize. Not because I mean it, but because I don't want to die. I'm not certain it will help - it's three bloky builder types who (stereotypically, I admit) aren't known for calm reasonable discussion. But I don't see what other option I have.

I'm a decent non-competitive cyclist.  I ride for fun and health.  I have been able to pull off 4000+ kms in a season, which in this part of the world (Canadian prairies), it's pretty hard to do.  We have 4 cycling months to ride in, maybe 6 if you stretch it into less than ideal riding weather.

In January I contracted Covid.  It hit me pretty hard, knocked me on my ass actually.  I consider myself a pretty fit 50+ year old male, but wow, that was harsh.  Since then I seem to be in a tailspin, unable to get motivated to do much.  I also picked up a few bad habbits that don't need to be discussed here, but that I need to quit.

We're still a full month away from getting out on that ""first"" ride, but until then, I've decided to kick the bad habbits cold turkey and get back on the fitness routine.  Treadmill, weights, indoor cycling, all to gear up for great season.

Since cycling is very much a community, I thought it would be helpful to create a post of encouragement.  It seems so easy to fall off the wagon these days.  If you're anything like me, hopefully I have given you the momentum or a push to get back on track!

1602074554.0,"""Nice Spandex""","The driver overshot the white line that marks where the crosswalk begins by about one-and-a-half car lengths. 

I was cursing under my breath as I navigated around his car, placing me into the onrushing traffic.

He must have heard as he shouted at me after I passed. Keep riding I told myself, but against my better judgement, circled back and issued a fairly standard reply:

""WHAT?!!!!"", I shouted back.

It's a busy intersection servicing an even busier interstate interchange. There must be 10,000 cars passing through daily. I've passed through myself on a bike countless times and have long since ceased being surprised by what happens here.

It's an important transition point between riders who stay local and those who want to continue in the greater metro area. To say it's not built for cyclists is an understatement, but this is the only way out of town.

""Nice Spandex bleep bleep bleep"", was his reply.

""Fuck-off"", I told him nonchalantly and turned back onto the original pathway.

I thought it was over, but this is when his engine roared to life and with tires squealing, he made a right-turn from the left-turn lane, cutting off the other drivers who were in the right-turn lane. He next made another right-turn, hopped the curb, crossed my path and forced me to brake hard to avoid a collision. Clearly this cat's off his MEDs. 

I quickly went around his car yet again, back onto the path and made a beeline for the nearby Circle-K service station, where I knew there'd be witnesses in case the situation escalated further.

Apparently he wasn't interested in having witnesses and continued on shouting epithets and speeded away.

I was mildly shaken, but continued on with my ride.

On a scale of 1 to 10 this was about a 5. I've had much worse. From a danger perspective, it was fairly low. More of an irritation. 

I'm not unique, ride enough miles and this kind of event becomes fairly commonplace.

I've given up trying to figure out the why. There's no pay dirt in it. It's more about trying to make sure it doesn't bring me down, discourage from engaging in an activity that I have every right to be doing.

A little while later, on the trail, still a bit down, when I passed by a young mother walking. I slowed down and overheard her telling others that her daughter was on a bike but the two separated. I remembered seeing the little girl, stopped, assured the mom that it was going to be OK, that I'd seen her a hundred meters away, and would help them get reunited.

It felt pretty good to help and erased the negativity of earlier. It also helped seeing the other people rallying around the young mother and her lost daughter. 

These types of occurrences are not unusual on the trail. Once, I delivered a juice-box to a kid going into diabetic shock on the Big Dam Bridge. His frantic mother had just retrieved it from her car in the parking lot but was maybe a mile from her child. It was one of the best miles that I've ever ridden. Another time, an old man who happened to be a veteran, got his electric wheelchair stuck off the path, and couldn't get back onto it. Helping others in these types of situations is a privilege. We get more from it than they do.

A good metaphor for life. Ignore the bad stuff (that can't be fixed), embrace the good. Do what you can to help others.

BUT, when I am riding a bicycle, hell yeah, it feels so good! It really makes me start loving life.

I don't have any special expensive sportsy kind of bicycle. It's an ordinary road bike. No suspensions. I got it a long time ago when I was a kid, but it was too big for me back then. I am 25 years old now. So it's quite old as well, but it's going very well. I am going uphills, downhills, on unpaved roads through the woods, using it to the max, and it's still great.

I live in a very hilly area, so it is impossible to avoid climbing. But what I love about it is that I get a downhill afterwards as a well earned reward. What I love especially is the beautiful nature! Forests, rivers. There is a small waterfall that I like to sit by and rest for a bit. No bad thoughts coming to my mind then!

I am not an athletic type of guy and not into sports like football etc. But, cycling is the best sport ever! Every day I am getting better at climbing those hills, and who knows what could become of me in the future, so that's what makes me stop thinking about suicide and stuff. Also, you don't need friends to cycle. I don't have any, I've got myself and the nature.

Thanks to this subreddit and all you guys. It's been nice to read all the posts by like-minded people. Now I decided to make an account and tell my little story.",cycling,2020-08-27 20:47:05
1591883278.0,3 months into training and I’m completely hooked,"I’m a former competitive swimmer (swammer). When the plague hit, I started riding my dads 20 year old hybrid a lot more. Sure, I had taken it out once every couple of weeks over the last year, but never for more than 15 mostly flat miles. That thing is HEAVY and it was holding me back. But after committing to going out a few times a week, and climbing up to 25-30 miles, I knew it was time for my first road bike. I got a giant contend 1 about 2 months ago and I’m hooked. A few bonks, a couple of falls, some close calls with cars have taught me a lot. Now I’m regularly going for 50+ mile rides, and have a goal of reaching a century by my 29th bday in July. I have a totally new respect for the sport, as it’s the only thing to leave me with that full body exhaustion in the same way that swimming does. I intend to keep cycling as a lifelong hobby",cycling,2020-06-11 13:47:58
1668350773.0,Grateful to mushrooms for getting me back on the bike,"I've posted bits and pieces before but I just want to share some more of my journey.  I'm a former Cat2 racer/TT-breakaway specialist and am back on the bike after nearly 20 years.  Life, career, kids, etc all piled up and I just couldn't maintain my training or riding at any level.  Went through a lot of shit and changes in the intervening decades but the love of cycling was always there in my mind.  Not a day went by that I didn't dream about the bike or relive races I'd won, or hyper-analyse my losses.  

Jan 2022- I'm overweight, drinking every day, in a rut I've been trying to get out of for years.  Depressed?  Maybe.  At the very least I had a lot of the symptoms.  I'd been doing a lot of work in the previous 7 years with psychedelic therapy to overcome the many challenges a shitty and abusive childhood saddled me with but I was still in this place of complete inaction regarding my physicality.  

I did a journey that month with mushrooms that ended up changing everything.  I came out of the experience without much of a message and went to the kitchen to get some water.  As I passed the very well stocked liquor cabinet I literally said 'ew' out loud and was utterly grossed out by the idea of alcohol.  There was the message and I decided to listen.  

Gave up the booze right then and there.  I committed to not drinking for at least two months to see what changes occurred.  It was surprisingly easy to not drink, thankfully.  Within a week and a half I was so much more engaged with life and my body, my brain began to wake up.  I started reading again, something I hadn't done in seemingly forever, was sleeping better, got my diet under almost immediate control, and I suddenly had motivation and wanted to ride again.  Still off the booze to this day with zero desire to have even a sip.  

January here means we are covered in deep snow and riding outside it not an option with road bikes so I bought a smart trainer, hooked my old CX bike up to it, and got busy.  

Holy fuck did that first ride suck.  No surprise, right?  Not having done any fitness training in forever I did 20min at about 180W and thought I was going to die.  I'm actually chuckling at how shitty I felt after but also how damned good it felt to pedal myself to the point of abject suffering again.  

I kept at it, hooked up with the same coach that I'd worked with back in the day, and I just hit a personal benchmark yesterday that prompted me to write.  It's nine and a half months since that first ride and I just did a relatively easy zone1, 4hr, 75mile ride at 19mph average with a NP of 220.  I'm 60lb lighter, my blood pressure is down from stage1 hypertension to perfectly normal, RHR is 42, and my FTP is somewhere around 350-360 (calculated, not done a proper test in quite a while) with the goal of getting that to 500, or about where I was previously which my coach thinks is quite possible.  Thankfully slow-twitch/aerobic power decreases far less than fast-twitch/anaerobic which I never had anyway.  

I got off the bike yesterday and laughed out loud at having done something I would have thought utterly inconceivable 3/4 of a year ago.   I still want to go faster/farther, maybe all they way to Masters National TT, but honestly even if I never get any stronger than I am right now I'm so bloody happy and grateful to be back on the bike and digging deep into the suitcase of courage to turn the pedals in anger once again.  I'd forgotten how much being physically fit impacts one's psychological/emotional state.  I'm more stable, happy, resilient, patience, kind, and, I think, an overall better human being than I was before that fateful experience in January.  

Thanks for reading and I hope you all get to ride today.",cycling,2022-11-13 14:46:13
1665606199.0,Autumn cycling safety reminders.,"Yearly reminder of some of the hazards of cycling into the fall and colder months that’s can save you from a crash or worse.

-It is getting darker earlier and lights are more important than ever. Take a small backup set if possible and make sure they are charged before heading out. On an overcast/rainy day those lights are the only thing a car can see. 

-Leaves (and especially wet leaves) are slick. Take your time when riding and cornering when you see them.

-For the (gravel, adventure, mtb) wood bridges are like ice when they are wet. Never assume you will have any traction riding on them. Slow down and possibly unclip. 

-Wool socks, gloves, and base layers can keep you warm even if they get wet. 

-Try to wear some high visibility contrasting colors. And always wear your damn helmet! 

-Remember to keep your saddle bag full of essentials for a flat and carry some cash. 

-Hydration is still just as important as it is in the summer months. Drink up. 

Safe riding and please add any additional tips. <3",cycling,2022-10-12 20:23:19

It's apparently super cheap, but it sucks all balls to ride a bike on as the stickiness combined with the rotation of your tires causes little pieces of gravel to be flung up all over your bike, shoes, legs, etc. I had JUST cleaned and lubed my bike chain yesterday, too. It was a smooth ride in the morning, but my later rides felt like I was trying to ride straight through the Swamp of Sadness. I swear it somehow tarred up my newly-lubed chain, but I just went out and lubed it up all over again, so hopefully I just didn't do a good job the first time (this was my first time lubing a bike chain and I like to think I did it right).

1608570586.0,PSA: Don't be like me and end up with a 6+ month problem,"TLDR; if you have any kind of rash, bump, etc. that hurts when you ride your bike, stop riding that day and don't get back on until you're 100% cleared. Otherwise you could be in pain for months or years to come.

I know it's common knowledge not to aggravate an injury but like many of you I love nothing more than riding my bike. 6 months ago I bought a few new pairs of bib shorts and started to develop a saddle rash / sore, for the first time ever, which was shocking to me as I'd never had issues in the past. For the next few weeks I was hyper vigilant about sanitation on all dimensions, and rode less / less intensely to avoid making things worse.

Not wanting to lose the end of the summer weather, with no real progress healing, I figured it couldn't make it that much worse if I just rode for the last month - and then I would take weeks off if needed. Which is, exactly what I did. But 3 weeks off the bike, and this small (now visible) lump remained. All fall I was on and off the bike, the bump never getting better nor worse but always 5/10 pain level when riding. I saw a doctor who said it was probably a hematoma (bleeding under the skin) which should reside, but 3 more months passed and nothing got better. Finally today I got around to seeing a doctor, who sent me into surgery to cut it out. And they took out much more than they thought they had to - a deep cyst had formed (GROSS!) and they literally had to surgically cut the whole thing out.

Now my butt is stitched up (wow that sounds dirty) and I'm stuck off the bike for probably another 4 weeks.

RIDE CAREFULLY!

Didn't need too much, few new parts, bit of grease... nothing an amateur like myself couldn't handle.

For ages I tinkered, with micro adjustments to fine tune the shifting but with no success. Continuing to use ERG mode, I hung my head in shame as I thought the issue beat me.

Turns out, when I rebuilt the bike, I put the small chain ring on backwards, so the gap between the two rings was slightly too big. I'm amazed that it had worked at all but it did!

1622399458.0,Reminder why good sunglasses are important!,"A couple of days ago I got into my first major crash. T-Boned by a truck going about 60-70km/h. Luckily I walked away with a couple fractures and a collapsed lung. No concussion (wear your helmets kids), no whiplash, and no major facial lacerations.

One of the less well known components of safety gear is a good pair of sunglasses. I have a pair of Smith Attack Max's that really saved my face during the crash. I took a large punch of the impact to the face and had I worn cheaper sunglasses there is the risk they may have shattered and throw extra debris into my face. Instead, they stay on my face during the crash and I walked away with no blackeyes, no broken nose, and no facial lacerations apart from a little road rash on one of my cheeks. The glasses are a write-off ([damage shot](https://imgur.com/a/WGYTK2b)) but at least my face isn't! Protect your eyes!


*EDIT: Since this post got more traction than I thought it would I want to clarify some stuff based on helpful comments. I should not have used the distinction ""cheap"" vs ""expensive"" later in my post. I wanted to highlight the impact of GOOD glasses which, as many have pointed out don't require you to buy $300 glasses (3M tinted safeties work fine as well). I just wanted this to be a PSA to make sure you know what you're buying (polycarbonate vs acrylic vs glass) and how they're rated from a safety perspective.

I describe myself as an avid cyclist, riding 100 miles per week. I don't race or participate in group rides, but cycling is in my blood. My bike is a 2009 Giant Seek 3, for which I paid about $600. I absolutely love it. I've adjusted & replaced various parts over the years, but it is a pleasure to ride and is perfect for the mixed terrain I ride on.

1649675911.0,I made my own energy gel and I’m not going back to brand stuff,"I’ve been using SIS GO for a while but I’m not a fan of their price and messy packaging.

So I decided to make my own!

Googled some recipes and thought using natural ingredients like honey and agave syrup is asking for a bathroom emergency. I also assumed vitamins in a gel is marketing – want a good micronutrient balance – eat more veggies! Went with more basic stuff instead.

My recipe:

**Carbohydrate base:**

\- 2 parts by weight maltodextrin powder

\- 1 part fructose powder

\- 1.5 parts water

Blend together, add 1 gr. sodium alginate (natural thickener) dissolved in a small amount of cold water. Blend to uniform consistency. Store in a fridge. Shelf life may vary, I’ve had my base sit for a month and it was good as fresh.

Decided to go without isotonic ingredients, for simplicity and because I already add isotonics to my water.

**Flavouring**: whatever you like. I use cranberry jam. Optionally - a teaspoon of liqueur per 250ml. of gel to enhance the flavor. Flavoring is best added before a ride. Storing flavored gel may reduce shelf life.

**Container**: a soft 250 ml. flask with a camelback style nozzle (bite and drink) works great, easy to use, no mess. One flask is good for 3-4 hours of fast-pace riding.

**Energy density**: roughly 63-64% carbohydrates by weight (if my math is true), about on par with brand gels. It also combines fast (maltodextrin – glycemic index 105) and slow (fructose, GI – 19) carbs.

**Testing**: Did 2 long-ish road rides, 3 hr and 2.20, just below threshold HR. The gel worked as expected, maintained pace and felt good all the way – much like with SIS. The gel tastes good, absorbtion felt quick. Easy on the stomach – no discomfort during the ride or the next day. The flask is much better than single-use pouches.

So there’s that. Guess I’m making my own race fuel now.

Cheers!

Edit: sodium alginate, not potassium",cycling,2022-04-11 11:18:31
1624122414.0,Today I started; my weight loss journey.,"I picked up a cheap exercise bike on facebook marketplace for $10.

I cleaned out my kitchen and anything unhealthy such as snacks, soda, processed food, I literally just threw it in the bin. From now on if I'm thirsty, it's only gonna be water. And I just did 15 minutes on the bike non-stop on a medium gear. My legs are kinda shaking a bit (mind you I have not worked out anything for 15 years at this point, other than a few walks here and there). I will go for another 15 minutes later in the evening. I'll try do 15min every morning from now on and 15 min at night. It may not be much but it sure as hell is better than nothing.

I'm 26 years old, 180cm and 115kg. 

I'll try eat as healthy as I can and try my best to reach my goal of 75 kg. At the moment, I don't care much about muscle. I just wanna lose weight cus I can't deal with this shit anymore. If I don't change my lifestyle now, then I'll never make it. Working in IT sure as hell don't help, since I sit at least 6 hours per day in front of the computer.

Just sitting on the bike was hurting like hell for the first 5 minutes. Dunno if that's the seat that's terrible, or I'm just so used to my office chair. But god damn, I felt like my ass would die. But then after those first 5 minutes I just didn't feel anything anymore and kept going.

&#x200B;

* Only water, no soda/juice/anything else for drink
* Much more vegetables and fruit during the day.
* No processed food, snacks, or any unhealthy food. I even got rid of my salt. Don't need it.
* Start with 15min cycling in morning, 15min in the evening. Then work my way up to 30min in morning, 30min in evening during the next coming weeks.

It's a start I guess. Better than nothing.

&#x200B;

Now I'm gonna walk to the store (not use my car, as I usually do!) and buy some vegetables. It's nice weather (30c) and might as well get an extra 15 min walk to the store, 15min back. See you!",cycling,2021-06-19 17:06:54

We went to the closest coffee shop that was on our route, which was still another 10km away, sat down and talked about if we should even keep going or if I should just bike home and come back to get her.

1660795432.0,"Almost died. How to signal ""don't pass me""?","How do you signal to the car behind you that it's not safe to pass? 

I've done over 12,000 miles of cycling on pedestrian paths in the past two years, but I just started cycling on roads last week. Tonight, a woman in her convertible passed me on a corner with oncoming traffic in the other lane, then almost drove me off the road.

I frequently check behind, so I knew she was coming up. I saw the car coming towards me in the other lane, so I rode in the center of our lane to discourage her from passing me. Then, when I heard her getting really close, I looked back and stuck out my left hand in an attempt to tell her it wasn't safe to pass (like a left turn signal, but angled downward). She passed anyways, so I moved over to the right as far as I could. She almost hit the oncoming truck, then almost forced me off the road when she swerved back before speeding away.

I know you should be a defensive rider, but there wasn't a ridable shoulder, and there are gravel ditches on both sides of the road, so I wasn't able to just move to the side.

I ride around farmland, so there isn't a ton of traffic, but I want to be prepared if I'm in this situation again. The speed limit was 50 mph and I was going ~25 mph. Honestly, I'm not sure how she didn't see the oncoming car, but that doesn't matter. What would you have done?

Edit: 

I'm not sure if it makes a difference, but some people are mentioning cyclist visibility. I had a flashing tail light, a rear solid red helmet light, and a flashing headlight. I wear a white helmet, and my jersey, rear rack bag, and bib shorts have reflective strips on them.

Edit 2:

I'm riding in the US (right side of the road)

Edit 3:

I've been practicing a lot of your suggestions. When it's not safe to pass, I take the lane and hold out my left arm at 45 degrees with my hand open and facing backwards. Then when it's safe to pass, I move over and wave people by. The vast majority of people driving in my area are safe around me. The experience from my post was just an instance of someone who made a bad decision. Everyone makes mistakes, but I sure hope this doesn't happen often. One bad experience won't keep me off the road.

What was supposed to be a 4hr ride got cut short to just less than 2 because I just couldn't take anymore of the anti-cycling road design and angry drivers.

I don't get rattled easily and am primarily a road rider.  I'm used to the selfish fuckery of the average car driver, but holy shit. It was not entirely unexpected, of course, but Texans really seem to actively hate cyclists at a whole different level.  I lost count of extremely close calls and cars that turned right in front of me or crowded me to the shoulder.

The biggest issue was the shoulders themselves.  There was usually sufficient shoulder to ride but they all had rumble strips carved into them! This caused me to ride in the lane of traffic and, as you all well know, is not ideal in the best of circumstances.  This condition of the shoulders was something I was surprised by and eventually realized it simply wasn't worth it.

Obviously Texas is huge and maybe there are better places to ride but I'll probably not find out. This ride was stressful and unenjoyable to the point where I'm done with TX for good.  Also, I expect I'll be a lot more grateful for the relatively chill scene back where I live. It's not perfect but at least it's not Texas.",cycling,2023-01-08 16:06:17

1599819800.0,My cycle has been helping me save my self," 

I wanted to share a small part of my story with cycling and hope that the community would welcome this small tidbit of my life.

I am a refugee living in India, my life hasn't been particularly easy, but yet it has been better than most, i got to experience many things, try so many things, and achieved much, i have always been a social person, traveled a lot, and met many people.

Then suddenly the Covid pandemic hit us, and a one day lock-down was announced that later expanded into another day and another and before you know it it had been 3 months already that i have been inside my house and haven't had the chance to go out of this cage.

It of course took it's toll at the start, though i didn't notice, and i got a bit withdrawn, and slowly the loneliness started creeping in, with my family living together of course that only added to the tension with the many fights that happened due to being locked inside with each other

So when July came and just a bit of the restrictions were lifted i went online and started looking at cycles to get an excuse to leave the house, i posted what i'm looking for on so many sites and waited, and every offer i got was either too bad or the size didn't fit, till one day, an old guy contacted me, he had a cycle that he used only on his trainer that he was letting go to me at a very reasonable price ( turns out he really was letting it go for far below it's cost)

So i went and at 20th July got my first road cycle, and at the start i was pants at it, could barely do 10 Km at slow speed without having the breath knocked out of me, but that changed, i started searching for the local cycling groups and found two of them, did a ride with each and joined the one i liked more, and so it started.

I started joining them daily (or as much as i could wake up early) i admit that sometime the laziness overtook me and i just stayed in bed, once i didn't cycle a week due to having a complete mental breakdown, and i admit i spent that week just crying my eyes out.

But i remembered one thing, the feeling i get when i am cycling, that sweet spot when i am at my 25th km, with the music in one ear, and i get lost in my mind, i start laughing out of nowhere, happy for anything, making up funny stories in my head, and i slowly started getting better, I have been cycling a bit over two and a half month, and in this time i have done 4 century rides, one inter-state ride, and over 1600 Km of cycling, and i truly feel so proud and happy of myself, i feel so strong for the lack of better word, i take pride in myself and my cycle, this is the one thing i did to make myself happy, i have achieved much in life, but it was all because i had to, this is the one thing i do because i want to.

I do have a lot to get yet, i need to replace one of the tires, get cycle lights desperately, and so much more, but the lack of money stops me for now.

Today i went for 60km with my group and i just feel so strong today, i feel like i truly can and will hold the sun, i want to visit the Taj Mahal on my cycle a 250 Km ride, i want to do 2000 Km by the end of this month, and so much more.

This is just a small story of my cycling Journey, I do hope at least someone managed to get through my inane rambling",cycling,2020-09-11 10:23:20

The crosswalk isn't shared, so I use the bike box to cut over to Burrard on my commute. Drivers are always going to violate the signage, and often swing wide around the box and onto Helmcken EB while I'm waiting at the light.

Today a driver slowed up, assessed me, looked around, and made this terrible turn. He didn't swing wide enough and in an instant he was in my bubble space green box. He couldn't move forward without turning into me due to the angle, so I caught his attention through his closed passenger window and pointed to the road signs without speaking, he casually pointed to the street behind me and crept forward until he was inches away from my leg. I pointed down Hornby and back up to the signs, you get the idea. My big giant stupid pantomime display caught the eye of the VPD.

""Cyclist, are you ok?"" I heard a husky male voice, and I looked over my shoulder to see an unmarked cop car. I replied that I was alright, but this driver. ""I'll have a talk with him"" the officer said with a stern face. He was out of his car in an instant; he was a plain clothes bad ass knight with a shining badge!

I was kind of in shock the driver chose to come so close to me, otherwise I think I would have dismounted completely and just stepped aside. I regret not saying ""thank you"" as the officer got right to it speaking to the driver, so cheers to the RCMP for having my back.

1594131803.0,Cycling for mental health,"I wanted to share my experience with the community so here it goes.

I've been into road cycling for a couple of years, I am currently located in Sheffield UK, very close to the Peak District which is an awesome place for cycling, it's topology is one of the reasons why I got hooked cycling (lots of hills, nice views, quiet lanes). I think I became a little addicted to the physical sensations of cycling uphill and getting exhausted on the bike.

Everything was going great until last September. Due to external factors, I decided I needed to focus on non-cycling activities for a bit. Unfortunately, this went on for longer than planned. During this time, my mental health started fading slowly. I lost control of my diet and became sedentary. Then, the COVID situation came and I just prolonged this lifestyle. This reached a point where I found myself feeling depressed. I had lost the will to do anything at all, and I was about 20 lbs heavier than last September. By April/May, most of my friends were solo cycling. I tried a couple of short-ish rides on my own and realized I had lost all the fitness. I think this triggered me, I panicked and wanted to die but didn't act on this. I decided I had to do something more constructive.

My wife, who prefers jogging, was keen to join me for some easy rides. During each ride, I was feeling better. So, we kept cycling, meanwhile, I contacted one of my cycling friends which I was hesitant to do due to my decreased fitness. Yet, the ride went good, I was still out of breath on previously easy ramps but I felt great, I needed more cycling.

Unfortunately, group riding was still not possible so I decided to fetch the old dumb trainer (which I did not enjoy using) and try any of the cycling apps offering free trials but I needed something compatible with a very old trainer and speed and cadence sensors. I found the sufferfest and zwift. In both cases, the trainer was not supported. I started the trial period for the sufferfest anyway. A couple of sessions were a great workout and I was hooked indoor training. By this time I was feeling better and group rides were now possible. I joined the cycling group I used to cycle with on a Weekend ride and it was great. Still, I was not able to maintain the same pace as last year but I was already feeling better daily. I needed to train more, I started the trial period on zwift. Initially, I thought this was just a silly game and not really for me until I got into a race and I was hooked. By the end of my trial, I joined an event on Alpe du zwift and found it not as hard I was expecting, I completed the climb in 1 hour 15 minutes, ahead of friends who were dropping me on the group ride. I got suspicious this was because of my lack of a real power meter so I started shopping for one, unfortunately, the models I wanted have been out of stock everywhere and the waiting period was about 50 days! Anyway, two weeks later, I was notified some were in stock and I placed my order. Last night, I did my second attempt at AdZ (now using a PM) which I completed in 1 hour and 40 minutes. This is more in line with my real-life performance, it felt harder, I loved it. These may be just indoor sessions, but I know they are there when I need my cycling fix or if I do not have a lot of time available or when the weather is not great.

Now, I have lost some of the lbs I gained and I am feeling way better every day. My mental health has improved significantly, I can go a full day without feeling sad. I can think about the situations that were previously worrying me a lot without triggering high levels of anxiety.

1581552735.0,"About a month ago, using a stationary exercise bike, Oculus Rift VR Goggles, and Google Earth VR app with ""street view"", I started a VR bike-ride across Japan. 719 miles into my ride…I still have a long way to go before hitting my goal of the northern most point of Japan!","**Set up:**

As I mentioned in my post, my equipment includes the Oculus Rift, The Google Earth VR App, and my exercise bike. I also have multiple fans blowing from various directions to address “sweating” in the headset. The faceguard on the headset is also removable for cleaning. 

I use google maps on my phone and computer to plan, navigate and plot my route. 

**Method:**

I ride the stationary bike while wearing my VR goggles. I use a controller to manually advance the 360 photos and “steer” the bike in “street view”. Going up hill, I advance the pictures closer to the bike to approximate the slower pace of going up hill. Going down hill, I advance the pictures farther from the bike to approximate the speed of downhill biking. I manually adjust the tension level on the bike. While I certainly could adjust the tension for uphills and downhills, I’m not particularly going for realism, I’m doing this for exercise. I manually increase the tension as I ride, increasing until I reach the maximum tension I can endure and then I stay there… increasing bit by bit week after week. Basically, I’m riding “uphill” all the time. 

Advancing the 360 pictures is like a “rudimentary” flip book or video. Given the speed of a bicycle, it approximates movement. I have found the pictures to be higher resolution than 360 video, and less “motion sickness” inducing. I have averaged 10-22mph given the type of ride I am doing that day. I’m typically only riding 2-3 hours per day, sometimes less, given my busy schedule.

**What I Like:**

I’m really enjoying the immersive nature of this VR ride. It scratches a travel itch, without the cost of travel. I have some physical and medical issues that might make a ride like this virtually impossible for me…so I really enjoy the fact that I can take my time, and do this ride a couple of hours per day in smaller chunks, rather than pushing myself to complete it on a specific time table. I can ride any time, day or night and I have full climate control. 

I like the open nature of  “Google Earth”. Unlike other apps that might require a specific program track, if I want to alter my course on the go… I can. 

I really enjoy some of the sites on my journey. There have been moments where I have stopped just to enjoy the view from a bridge, a local landmark, or an interesting looking building.  

Some interesting landmarks like Japanese Temples, Castles, Parks, Outdoor markets, etc. offer 360 tours through Google Street view as well…so as I’m riding through various cities I can stop and enjoy some of the tourist attractions along the way.

Sometimes the “Street view” changes seasons while riding down the street… so it allows me to see spring or fall views of a village, rainy days, summer days…flowers blooming, etc.    
 

Although I’m not really riding, this trip has given me a mental map that really makes it feel as if I am actually biking across Japan.  
 

**What I Don’t Like:**

Google Earth VR was not intended for this purpose. It can be glitchy. Sometimes the app fails to load or start properly, which can lead to frustrating delays. 

Navigation within Google maps can be difficult. It is hard to know where I am. It is like the old days before GPS. I have to actually look at a map to figure out where I am. I don’t read Japanese, so I typically stick to numbered highways, trying to avoid expressways as I would on a real ride.  
 

Google Maps can be finicky. I’ve had it stop working in the middle of a ride and refuse to advance the picture. I’ve had it unexpectedly teleport me from an overpass to the pedestrian tunnel under the overpass or to a side street near the overpass.  Sometimes the view will alternate between opposite sides of a divided highway which can cause a bit of disorientation or break in the immersive nature of this journey.

I have often been faced with either continuing to ride with a glitchy app, or resetting it while continuing to ride. Sometimes I will use the reset for a water break, quick snack or bathroom break. 

Conclusion:

While it is certainly not without it’s glitches, the pros outweigh the cons for me anyway… and I’m continuing my goal to reach Northern Japan.",cycling,2020-02-13 00:12:15
1564230690.0,Cycling Saved My Life,"A year ago-- I believe-- I posted about how cycling had saved my life. Well, I wanted to share the story again-- for those that didn't read it, and because this year is an important anniversary for me.

Throughout my adult life I have had anxiety-- basic anxiety which I have taken medicine for. I have, however, had it pretty good (I have a good job, a great wife, two beautiful kids, etc...) But unbeknownst to be, my anxiety turned into depression -- or I had depression all along and it came out the last few years. What I did not realize, though, was the effect it was having on me and my relationships. A few years ago I became increasingly irritable, frustrated, and reserved-- nothing I thought was abnormal since I have two young kids and a busy job (I am a teacher). I told myself that parenting was hard, teaching was hard, and frankly, life is busy: I did not have a lot of time to go out with friends, to engage in ""self-care"" or any of that stuff.

The arguments with my wife began getting worse-- whereas we would never raise our voices, I suddenly found myself yelling. I became increasingly demanding about tasks getting done and the feeling that she was not contributing enough to the relationship. Anyways-- as this is a cycling forum and a not a marriage or mental health forum-- I will skip ahead. Two years ago, my wife went to see her family in Florida-- she took both kids and I stayed home since I teach over the summer. We had been arguing during her time there, but nothing I thought too seriously about. When it was the night before her flight to come home, she texted me that she was going to stay in Florida for a few more days, to figure stuff out. I didn't think much about it. Well, a few days later, she said that she was not coming home, that she was not comfortable with the arguing, etc... and she had no intent of coming back. This pushed me to the edge-- so much (and it is painful to say it/write it) that I drove over to the train tracks and stood waiting for the train contemplating ending my life. I kept thinking that without my wife, without my kids, I had nothing-- it was truly the lowest point of my life. Thankfully the train did not come (I'm not a religious person or a believer, but wow, what a miracle that the train did not come by while I waited). Fast forward a few months later when she did come back and we started working things out. 

But there was still a problem with my depression: my psychiatrist tried various medicines (which definitely helped), but I could not get out of the rut I was in. I loved time with my kids and wife, but I could not justify time for me-- and in retrospect, I did not like myself very much, so I hid it by spending all my time and energy on my family. Well, things seemed to stay consistent -- not great not bad-- and then I got another setback: after a routine physical exam (about 8 months ago), my doctor told me my triglyceride levels were very high, that I would need to take cholesterol medicine. 

That was it for me: that was the moment that I decided to take my life back. I had been cycling for a few months prior, but this, I decided was the wake-up call I needed. I started biking more often-- and more strenuously. I changed my diet, monitored my calories, and started practicing gratitude. 8 months later, I have now done the following:

\-Lost 25 lbs and gotten off the cholesterol medicine

\-Completed a 47-mile charity bike ride (and a 42-mile one).

And perhaps, most importantly, gotten a new lease on life: my wife and I have the type of relationship we should have always had, and I love myself more than I can remember. I still have anxiety and depression, of course, but each day feels like a victory not a defeat. My bike-- and cycling-- saved my life, in no uncertain terms. It has changed my physical appearance, my mental health, my marriage, my job, etc... 

So why post today? Well, my wife is with the kids in Florida visiting her family (the first time she has gone back without me since the time she stayed down there and things went really bad for me...) I keep reminding myself that this time is different, that we are not fighting, arguing, etc... But most important: I have my bike, now, so each day that I cycle, I feel my sense of calm settling in, reassuring myself that things are better. No medicine I have taken (though the medicines definitely help) could do or has done this for me. My wife will be back in a few days-- that I am confident of-- and even if I wasn't, i would just hop on my bike and go for a ride-- that way, I can ease my mind.

Thank you to everyone who supported me the last time I posted a long message like this-- you are all amazing people and I wish you happy and safe riding.

All best.",cycling,2019-07-27 12:31:30

1634572363.0,How many miles of riding to offset the carbon emissions cost of producing your bike?,"Answer: Around 400-500 miles if you ride a high-end carbon fiber bike, less if you ride aluminum/steel.

Source:
Per WAP Sustainability Consulting's study of Trek's 2020 Product Life Cycle [^1](https://ep1.pinkbike.org/p5pb21366387/p5pb21366387.jpg) a carbon fiber road bike costs ~200 kg of CO2 emissions. A typical passenger car emits about 411 grams CO2 per mile according to this EPA study.[^2](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/P100JPPH.txt?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&Client=EPA&Index=2011%20Thru%202015&Docs=&Query=&Time=&EndTime=&SearchMethod=1&TocRestrict=n&Toc=&TocEntry=&QField=&QFieldYear=&QFieldMonth=&QFieldDay=&UseQField=&IntQFieldOp=0&ExtQFieldOp=0&XmlQuery=&File=D%3A%5CZYFILES%5CINDEX%20DATA%5C11THRU15%5CTXT%5C00000011%5CP100JPPH.txt&User=ANONYMOUS&Password=anonymous&SortMethod=h%7C-&MaximumDocuments=1&FuzzyDegree=0&ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&Display=hpfr&DefSeekPage=x&SearchBack=ZyActionL&Back=ZyActionS&BackDesc=Results%20page&MaximumPages=1&ZyEntry=2)


* So divide 200,000 grams by 411 grams per mile and you get 486 miles. This number checks out--according to Trek's marketing page, they claim ""Rule of 430"" [Trek rule of 430](https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/the-rule-of-430/).

* That means if you've used your bike to commute or otherwise replace ~400-500 miles where otherwise you would have taken a car, then you've ""earned"" back the CO2 cost of your bike. If you're not riding a fancy carbon fiber road bike, but a simpler aluminum hybrid/mountain bike (e.g. Trek Marlin) then it's even less CO2 cost--closer to 100 kg. 

* One thing to consider is that these miles need to be ""car-replaced"" miles and not just, say, heading out to ride a 50 mile loop for fitness, since the typical person wouldn't just take their car out to drive for 50 miles in a circle and come back home. So grocery trips, commuting to work, riding to visit a friend's house, etc. And typically the fancier the carbon fiber bike, the less likely it's used for these utility trips.

I thought this was interesting to think about and made me reflect on the bikes that I own and whether I've ""earned back"" the carbon cost of the bike's production. What do you think? How often do you ride your bike for ""utility"" trips vs a ""fitness"" loop? How many miles of ""utility"" riding have you completed?",cycling,2021-10-18 15:52:43

I asked the mechanic to install some bar end brake levers on my single speed, pretty simple job (especially being that the guy says he's been a bike mechanic for more than 20 years). He quoted me 3 hours of labor at $100 an hour. I wish I was exaggerating. He claims it's because his time is worth more because he's an ""ebike mechanic"".

To prove to my friends (who swear this guy is the best thing ever, even though he charged one of them $150 bucks to change a tire tube) that this dude is at best a hack and at worst a scammer, I went home and did the job myself. It took me, a total amateur who had never installed any kind of brake levers before, 2.5 hours with a sandwich break in there.

Just for fun, I called another neerby bike shop (about a 45 minute drive away) to see what they would charge for that this morning. They quoted 20 bucks, 25 if they had to supply the brake cables. They also work on ebikes. What a scammer.",cycling,2023-05-14 16:29:11

Dear Diary:

""One night I took a cab home from work. As I opened the door to get out, I heard a man scream, “Hey!” directly into my ear. He was on a bike trying to force his way through the narrow space between the cab and a parked car. 

I pointed toward the other side of the street.

“Hey!” I yelled back. “Do you think you should be in the bike lane?” 

“You’re supposed to look!” he screamed again, and then shot off. 

I jumped out of the cab and shot off after him. For someone who was exhausted, I was running at a pretty good pace.

I was pleased and surprised when I caught up to him at an intersection where he had been forced to stop. I was ready to really dress him down about his complete lack of attention to New York City bike protocol.

I got right up next to him.

“Hey!” I screamed. 

He looked startled.

“Yeah?” he replied. 

“Are you all right?” I said. “You’re right. I should’ve looked.” 

“No,” he said. “You’re right. I should’ve been in the bike lane.” Then he, motioned for me to come close.

“C’mere,” he said. 

We hugged. 

“I’m sorry,” he said. “I’m having a really bad day.” 

“I’m sorry you’re having a bad day,” I said. “I hope it gets better.” 

“Thanks,” he said. “I hope you have a nice day, too.”

I saw a post on this sub about going for group rides.  The author mentioned that  if you weren't using proper cyclist kit you just shouldn't go.  While this makes sense (you gotta be able to keep up!) I feel like it might devalue the riders like me a little bit.  In my opinion, considering my wacky setup, I'm still just as much of a ""proper cyclist""  as somebody who's spent more on their bike than they did on their car.

As cyclists, we are the people who love to be out on two wheels, traveling whatever distance under our own power.  Regardless of our distance or speed records, I think we all deserve to call ourselves cyclists, or roadies, or whatever.

this monday, someone broke into our garage and stole a few things, including my bike. my parents were convinced this was a targeted robbery and the thief must’ve seen me around our neighbourhood on the bike. when we looked at our security camera footage, the guy literally just chose our house randomly. he tried breaking into our neighbours cars and garage first but wasn’t able to get in. he the. tried to break into our cars, then headed to our garage door when the cars wouldn’t open. he picked our lock and spent about 5 minutes in there while we were all sleeping like 10-15 meters away. he stole a few power tools and my bike. 

i keep beating myself up over this because my dad built a bike stand for me, with a built in bar i could attach a lock to. i hadn’t locked my bike up that night. in the footage, he was about to leave and saw my bike as he was stepping out. he took it at the last second. 

this honestly just really fucking sucks because the bike was so expensive and such a large purchase. it was my first good bike and it was taken in less than a week.

Currently speed limits only apply to motor vehicles. To me, though, this is just another government distraction, taking people's minds away from what the public, including cyclists, really needs. On the news report the (obviously unbiased) BBC reporter suggested that we would then need to have all cyclists registered with identifying markers on their bikes (an equivalent to car number plates). This would be, to my mind, using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The problem of speeding cyclists is tiny, infinitesimal. Registration of cycles/cyclists would be way too costly. If the cost is passed on to cyclists it would discourage new cyclists and lead to a continuation of overcrowded public transport in the major cities and increased motor car usage. I'm sure the subject will be quietly dropped very soon, of course. As I said, it's just a distraction as well as a method of giving non cyclists more reason to disparage bike riders.",cycling,2022-08-17 12:35:10

1592108157.0,Cyclist killed in Sonoma identified as Adrian Albert,"[This was posted 5 days ago on /r/cycling ](https://old.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/gyrj3g/cyclist_just_killed_on_the_road_i_bike_on_all_the/) and I commented about how unsafe Highway 12 was, not realizing I knew the person that had died. [They ID'ed him and I just heard about it today](https://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/11019617-181/bicyclist-killed-in-highway-12).

I'm so sad now knowing that this incident is personal and I commented on that post as if it was ""another dead cyclist"". He didn't have his ID on him so they couldn't identify him at the day of the incident. 

Adrian Anthony Albert was a person of true excellence. He was an entrepreneur, a dear friend, a loved family member, an avid outdoorsman and environmentalist, a passionate scientist and engineer, and a low-ego, high impact leader with unwavering integrity and grit. On June 5, 2020, he was tragically killed in a hit and run car crash in Sonoma County, one of the very places he hoped to protect with his AI-based wildfire prediction technology- while cycling down Highway 12. 

Adrian attended Stanford University where he received a PhD in Electrical Engineering with a thesis on machine learning for energy grids, and he completed a postdoc at MIT. He was most recently the Founder and CEO of Terrafuse , a venture-backed startup that uses artificial intelligence to provide actionable climate intelligence for our entire planet, including prediction of extreme climate events. Adrian was deeply passionate about and committed to his company's mission. 

Adrian had moved out of San Francisco to wine country to wait out the pandemic surrounded by the wilderness, his haven.  All that Adrian needed to be happy was to work on solutions for challenging, momentous societal problems and to be in nature. Adrian put everyone else first, and was deeply admired for his level-headed, thoughtful approach to all of his endeavors. He was empathetic, humble, and kind in all of his interactions and cared deeply about his family, friends and his Terrafuse team of employees, advisors, and investors. Adrian is survived by his family in Romania. Adrian has joined his grandfather in heaven, a priest, who helped raise him, and who instilled much of his unwavering ambition and intellectual curiosity.

My question is, realistically how quickly can an adult learn? Do you know anyone or have personal experience learning as an adult? I've watched a few youtube videos where people learn in a day or so, but that just seems unrealistic.

I'm not an outdoorsy person so I never particularly cared about it. But right now where I live, I spend $1500/year on transportation. I could get an electric bike for $1000 with enough range to cover my commute and save thousands over the next few years. But alas... I can't ride a bike.

There's no one I can ask right now to teach me. So I'm thinking... what if I just buy the bike and then start going to the park every night and every weekend and practice until I learn. But... I'm gonna look stupid (especially being alone) and if I don't learn I'm not sure I'll be able to return the bike to Amazon within 30 days, they might not accept it if it's used.

Anyway... should I go for it? What's your advice?

Edit: So many replies, thank you everyone! I don't have time to reply individually, but your input is much appreciated. Lots of people are saying you can learn in 1-2 days. I find that almost unbelievable because I've tried multiple times in the past and failed/gave up, but I guess I didn't do it right and wasn't as persistent as I should have been. I think I'll buy a second-hand bike for $100 just to learn on, go to a nearby park and just start trying, then once I can ride it (hopefully), I'll practice on less-busy streets for 1-2 months before I go for the electric bike (from a good store) and actually commute to work with it.

1641455683.0,Both following road laws and ignoring them are a lose-lose.,"In my experience in the US, motorized vehicle drivers get upset/impatient when cyclists follow road laws because the cyclists are “often in the way”.

Add to that the improved sleep, massive psychological/mood boost, and overall increase in confidence, life is almost immeasurably better than it was in January. It's crazy that there was a time not that long ago that I wasn't riding.

[EDIT/UPDATE]

Lots of questions.  Will do my best to answer.  :) 

Motivation?  I've always loved cycling.  I am a former Cat2 TT/breakaway specialist that had to stop racing for the usual reasons- there was no real money in cycling and I needed to eat and so did my kids.  My last good year of racing was 2002.  Won a fair few ITTs, a state level TTT, several road races, and took a couple orange jerseys at the Fitchburg/Longsjo stage race.  

Training?  Once I decided to get back onto the bike I immediately contacted my old coach at cyclecoach.com.  I'm simply following his programme.  Right now I'm doing appx 11-14hrs per week.  Not a tremendous amount, to be sure, but it's having all those massively positive effects I mentioned.  

I've also always been kind of a ""balls to the wall"" rider.  I don't like riding slow or easy and I absolutely despise recovery rides.  So that intensity has made it easy to hit performance and weight goals.  Started at about 280lb, down to sub 235 with a target of <210.  My racing weight back in the day was 195 but that may not be realistic at this point.  

What got me to actually do it?  Mushrooms.  No lie.  I've been using psychedelic medicines, both solo and with a therapist, for just over 7 years and they have literally saved my life, quantitatively and qualitatively, in many ways and many times over.  In January I had a solo experience and near the end walked out of my bedroom to get some water.  I glanced over at my liquor cabinet and felt a rush of revulsion and actually said, ""ew"", out loud.  I realized I was treating my body like shit (I actually already knew this but the medicine gave me the emotional kick in the arse I needed and got me to stop lying to myself) and needed to change.  I quit the booze right then and there, decided to change my diet, and committed to getting fit.  Within two weeks I had a new smart trainer, a Rouvy subscription, and my old CX bike hooked up and I've been pedaling ever since.  Life on the bike > life in the bottle.  

Diet?  I'm going to lose a lot of you with this one...strict keto/carnivore.  No carbs at all, totally animal-based.  This is complete and utter heresy for endurance sports, I know.  Why would I do this?  There is lots of new science, esp that re-analyses a lot of the old science we've heard over the years, that a carnivore diet is actually super healthy and helps stave off a lot of chronic diseases, even cancer.  Yeah, I know, fad diets and all....but this isn't a diet it's a lifestyle and my stats keep getting better so I'm not about to quit.  A really good intro to this is ""The Carnivore Code"" by Dr Paul Saladino.  Despite what we all learned growing up, a high (natural) fat diet that cuts out most, or eliminates, carbs will actually reduce cholesterol and arterial plaques.  It's actually insulin resistance, from high carb diets, that creates chemical changes that cause lipoproteins to accumulate in the arterial walls leading to atherosclerosis.  

What about energy on the bike?  Yeah, that's an issue.  Using fat as fuel instead of sugar means I have a slow burn vs the turbo boost of carbs.  Right now I can go 90min, at nearly any intensity, before the legs run out of juice and turn to lead.  It's actually fascinating because when I was racing 20 years ago, if I ran out of fuel I would have to eat or I would never recover any energy. But with this diet, that slow burn keeps going.   Even if I exceed that slow burn's capabilities, ie go over 90 min, if I wait 5-10 min and let it catch up I'm good to go, not even hungry.  I can do out, do a 2hr hammer session, and still not eat for a couple hours after.  That being said, I will supplement with some limited energy chews while on the bike for rides over 2:30 otherwise I can barely pedal.  

The real challenge will be if I ever want to race again but there is no real road racing scene anymore (WTF?!?!?!) and everything is about gravel racing which I have no interest in.  But I'm still currently focused on building strength and endurance and working on my health so keto is still working great.",cycling,2022-07-17 20:23:44

My mom wants me to quit the job because it is too far away and she says I will be too burnt out. She's mainly concerned because I very recently recovered from an eating disorder which made me very underweight. I'm completely better now though.

During that time I lost 6 kilos which were mostly body muscles. Then I began walking to recover for the past ten days.
Today I finally went for a ride to see how I do or if I can do the commute to work. Boy I felt this is the first time that I've ridden a bike. It was so hard going forward. I guess it will take a long time to recover from this. Muscles and lungs are amply destroyed.

1. Vaccine was not available to me or I would have taken it the first moment, I'm not an antivaxxer.

2. I was careful a lot always wearing double masks and avoiding public transport but my work is not remote so I get in touch with other people and as infection rates are high, exposure to virus becomes inevitable esp. with the delta variant.

Given the size of this sub, and the current boom that cycling is having, I believe that some kind of a pinned wiki with peer-reviewed answers (so nobody is spouting some bullshit that leads to injuries or bad purchasing decisions [or both]) that address a lot of these types of questions will be a great resource to both new and seasoned cyclists.

For me this is good metaphor for our connection to each other, to your partner or significant people in your life, even to yourself, we all make mistakes, we are all flawed and often need to fix our relationship and parts of ourselves, it is through this process that we grow closer to others and move towards who we are truly meant to be. Just like we maintain our bikes, we should maintain ourselves, our health, our relationships with others, just like we don't throw out our entire bike when something goes wrong with it, we shouldn't completely abandoned ourselves or others when things go wrong, but instead work to make it better and upgrade parts of ourselves when they fail, so our journey with ourselves and others can continue.",cycling,2021-04-15 07:39:59
1686444656.0,Crashed on my first ride with a 5k carbon bike.,"Throwaway because I am just absolutely devastated and really just want to vent. 

I picked up my dream bike today, a gravel capable carbon road bike with ultegra and my first set of clip in pedals (that have flats on the bottom too). 

I was passing by folks in a busy part of the bike trail, yelling out “on your left” and “bike passing” with AMPLE heads up for folks to know I’m coming up on them. I was also slowing down to a reasonable speed to take into account any unexpected (aka idiotic) movements. 

This duo of folks taking up the entire bike path was walking, I yelled out “ON YOUR LEFT” and they started walking to the right. Thinking I was safe, I started pedaling again. 

When I was about 15-20 feet away, the person on the left just walked out right in front of me! This was a narrower  part of the path I slammed my brakes but it was too late - I hit them right in the back going probably 5-10 mph. 

After checking if the person was ok, which they said they were and just started walking away, I turned my attention to my bike. 

The derailleur is f’d, the pedal is messed up, and it shifts like shit now. The hood of the right shifter is messed up, and I’m not sure about the frame at all. I heard carbon is bad after it crashes. I don’t want this to be the only ride I get out of it. 

I am, and feel like a complete idiot and asshole, but I had no options in that situation at all. This person literally changed direction to be right in front of me at the last second. And my poor bike didn’t do anything to deserve this. My wrists are hurting a lot, and I hope the other person is OK. I should have slowed down to walking speed. I should have expected the unexpected. I am an idiot. That person should have not started walking in the opposite direction they were going out of nowhere too! What a moron! 

I literally want to cry. Fuck my life.",cycling,2023-06-11 00:50:56
1666193089.0,I highly recommend kettlebell swings,"Been doing kettlebell swings almost daily and haven’t really been on the saddle in about a month and a half to 2 months.

Did a ride recently with the same group as usual, people that ride pretty frequently. We had a ride planned out that was about 60 miles with a decent amount of climbing, specifically one long, steep hill that kills you by the time you get to the top. I thought great, I’m gonna be so out of shape, this is gonna suck. Surprisingly, didn’t really feel tired the first half. I’m like ok, the hill’s coming. We get to the hill and I’m literally going up stronger than when I was riding frequently. I made it to the top way before the rest of the group aside from one guy that’s usually the one waiting for everybody. I’m tired, but not like I thought I’d be. I was amazed at how strong I was going up. Somewhere in the middle of my confusion while climbing, I realized I haven’t taken 2 months off, I’ve been doing KB swings, holy shit they translated over to cycling. Finished the rest of the ride relatively easy.

Aside from cycling, they’ve helped me a ton. I have weak glutes from my sedentary job which comes with hip, low back, and knee pain (I’m in my 30’s btw). KB swings have given me my glute and core strength back and I’m almost pain free for the most part. Feels like my body can hold itself up like it’s supposed to. I started with about 50 lb 2 arm swings and worked up to 80 lbs. I’ll do between 50-100 reps per day, with maybe a day or 2 off per week. Been pretty consistent with this for over a month now.

You HAVE to look up the proper way to do them though. I’d recommend Strongfirst’s videos, and anything written by Pavel.

1612112045.0,Two tips I feel like sharing after my ride today,"First: practice using your puncture repair tools *before* you need them out on the road. It's much easier to figure out how your mini pump or co2 canister works in the warm and the dry, especially as you only get one chance with co2. Have a go and make sure you can change a tyre using only what you take on a ride, otherwise there's no point taking it.

Which brings me onto tip number two: if you see someone on the side of the road struggling with their bike, stop and check if they need help. It might turn out the only problem is they don't know how to use their mini pump. 

After watching a dozen other cyclists whizz past I decided to stop and check on someone, took me all of two minutes show them how their mini pumps works and get back on the road, saving the poor bloke from waiting in the cold and the rain for a lift home. Of course, I needn't have stopped if he'd come across my first tip; so hopefully this post will save someone else a long walk home.",cycling,2021-01-31 16:54:05

We rented citibike and rode all around the city from Harlem, a loop around Central Park, and then down to Times Square before we went back home. Before then, it had been years before riding a bike. But that day, I was immediately hooked. I’ve never been so happy before, just riding around in a bike. I can’t stop thinking about it. Two weeks later I borrowed my cousin’s bike and rode around. I felt happy, and at peace like nothing I felt before. (Something that I rarely feel because I’m always home and I’m always stressed). I’m thinking of buying a Trek FX1 and riding for at least 30 minutes every morning. I also plan on going back to the city to just ride around and get lost in the bike lanes.

1604394095.0,Doesn’t hair or a hat protect the same way as MIPS?,"\- No, your hair or a hat does not give the same protection as Mips® Safety System. Let me explain why.

It’s all about the energy and the force that an impact creates. You can easily move your non-Mips helmet placed on top of your hair or a hat with your muscle power. You do not even have to use very much power to get the helmet in a sliding motion. But imagine that you have 14 people standing on your head (that is actually the force created during an impact) and try to move the helmet. It won't work. The pressure is far too high. In order to make the head slide in the helmet, you need something with a lot less friction. Mips® safety system allows the head to slide in the helmet during heavy impacts.

However, it is not unusual that consumers have this question. But it is very important to understand that the pressure during an impact is far too high for hair or a hat to allow your head slide in the helmet.",cycling,2020-11-03 09:01:35

But the Giant Contend is a sweet bike for $900. Giant Defy Advanced for $3,500 is amazing. Trek Domane AL 4 - looks great at $1,700. Trek Emonda SL 6 Disc pro at $3,600 is super duper! There's a range of prices and bikes in between too. 

The problem is consumers thinking they need or want $7K to $15K bikes. Those consumers have just fallen for targeted marketing. It's not the fault of the bicycle manufacturers who cater to this - it's pure profit so why wouldn't they? Why wouldn't they hire the marketers and send the bikes to youtubers to give fawning reviews? It's normal marketing practices, and it generates profits.

It's easy. Don't buy them, and when your buddy shows up to the ride with one, don't say ""wow nice bike!"". Cause it's not, it's just rampant consumerism.

Same goes with $500 Rapha kits, or $70 carbon water bottle holders.

First off, every time I pass by, he always standing at the edge of the road watching people pass. He usually has a beer in his hand and his garage is wide open blasting glam metal music. On a couple occasions he has noticed that I am approaching on my bike and grabs his rifle and patrols the edge of his property next to the road, all while he is completely sh*tfaced drunk. Terrifying experience. I like to go on nighttime bike rides sometimes but I have seen this man as late as midnight just standing by the road admiring his motorcycle and patrolling. When I pass by him at night, he usually shines a flashlight at me and then he walks all around is property shining the flashlight everywhere. If he has such a distrust of cyclists and pedestrians why would he buy a house right next to entrance of the most popular bike trail in town?

1603548607.0,I fell in love today!,"Well, it was actually yesterday, but I was composing this post in my head as I went.

We've all heard the sayings  / lyrics / mantras :

> *Life's a journey...*

> *Stop and smell the roses*

> *Life moves pretty fast, if you don't stop and look around once in a while you could miss it.*


A little backstory/  context: 4 years ago, I was fat (5'8"" & 235+ lbs), out of shape & pretty sure footed on my way to a type II diabetes diagnosis. I didn't like my myself, and I was ashamed I didn't have the energy to play with my (then) 2 & 4 year old daughters. I was *MAD* at myself. 

Fast forward to age 43. I lost 65 lbs, slowly becoming more fit through learning about nutrition, walking, resistance training and eventually weight lifting.. I've even built an all-out home gym (prior to Covid when prices for athletic equipment went through the roof)

In late August, I received a bike from my wife as a gift for my 43rd birthday: a Cannondale Quick 6 hybrid. Mainly so I can go riding with my now 7 year old daughter. I've started riding on Tuesdays and Thursdays as cardio training, lifting M/W/F and going for a nice ride with my daughter in Sundays.

I started off on the roads of SE Pennsylvania near my home. It's pretty hilly where I am, but it was good training! I started going 5 miles  then 10 over a few weeks.

Thats when I discovered the Penny Pack trail network near me. It's about 17+ miles of mostly gravel, some trail, some asphalt but not much elevation change. It winds its way from north east of Philadelphia to the Delaware River. 

I started riding this trail after work. Trying to beat my times in Strava. Trying to go further, faster, further. Grinding, training  *WORKING* 

Yesterday, I took a day off of work to grind out this trail. Mainly to see if I could use to commute to/ from work. I set out from my house, 3 miles uphill to get TO the trail head. after about 7 miles in, I just wasn't feeling it. My saddle felt wrong, my knees weren't working, my neck was cramping. So, I pulled over along the trail at a rocky outcropping overlooking the Pennypack creek to drink some water and stretch.

Thats when it happened. 

I noticed the light playing off the water as it flowed around the rocks. I smelled the peaty moss of the wet leafy under brush. I noticed the contrasting colors of the changing autumn leaves. I heard the breeze and the sounds of the foot-falls from runners up on the trail.

I just kinda sat there for a minute and found I ENJOYED being here!

I got back on my bike and started taking pictures. I looked around. I noticed beautiful things all over the place while paying no attention what-so-ever to pace, or cadence or even time. I just went where the trail did and soaked it in. 

It was magical!  I just wanted to keep going. I wasn't tired, I stopped whenever I saw something interesting. 

Next thing I knew, I had traversed the whole way through northeast Philadelphia and was standing on the shore of the Delaware River. 17.5 miles from where I started. 

The return trip was a bit more grueling, but I stopped several times, ate, and just didn't push myself.

Today is the day the tumblers of the Cosmos unlocked ; when all those lyrics & clichés become something other than the mindless drivel and trope we all file away.

It clicked.

Except that the guy behind me didn't know it was a mixed terrain ride, as he had only been following me on roads.  When I signaled and pointed that I was leaving the road for a gravel path off to the side...he followed me.  And wiped out pretty hard.  

He had been sticking pretty close for the last few turns and might have only been 2 lengths back at the time I signaled I was slowing and turning.  I have no idea if he knew what those signals meant.  All I know is he didn't successfully complete the turn.

As I entered the intersection the car took off on a collision course with me. I braked and turned hard left to try to go behind it but it was too late and I smashed into the right rear quarterpanel at about a 45 degree angle going close to 10 mph. The car, of course, kept going and left the scene.

I ended up face down on the pavement about 10 feet from the bike. My sunglasses were broken, there was blood running down my face, and pretty much everything hurt.

I laid there for a bit thinking about the choices I've made in life that brought me there and started cautiously moving one body part at a time to assess the damage. Since my limbs and spine seemed intact I sat up. Still alive, so that's good.

Witnesses had called the police and EMS but by the time they arrived I had determined that my injuries weren't ambulance worthy and declined treatment and transport to save myself a few thousand dollars.

All I could tell the police about the car was that it was white and hard, I guess some of the witnesses added to that somewhat. I called a friend with a truck and he collected me and the bike and took me to the ER where I work.

My cow orkers gave me VIP treatment and after some x-rays and CTs (which will cost me a small fortune) it was determined that I had broken my nose and one rib and lost a lot of skin. Definitely could have been worse.

On Tuesday I took the bike to the shop. The front wheel, fork, and possibly the frame were bent. It would cost more to repair than I paid for it so I now have some road bike parts for sale if you need any.

On Wednesday I decided that I needed to get back on the horse and ride again so I set out on my backup bicycle. We all have a backup bicycle, right?

A mile from home I rode through a puddle and the wheels came out from under me. Monday's injuries were all on the left, Wednesday's are on the right. Nothing new broken but if I keep this up I'm going to run out of skin.

I think I'll take the rest of the week off and think about things for a bit. I've ridden a couple of thousand miles since my last significant fall but I'm definitely on a streak right now.

I come to you today seeking your collective advice. This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I’m a 34 year old male, a former smoker for 20 years (*I quit two months ago!*),  and am overweight. I’m 6’ and roughly 240lbs. I’m strongly considering  getting into cycling to lose this weight. For reference I’ve been  overweight since I was 16.

I live  in Colorado. Most of my biking will be on cement, asphalt, and some dirt  roads. I don’t intend to try anything “mountainous” for the time being –  but would like to be able to tackle some beginner trails eventually. I  also intend to use it to commute to work (about ½ mile each way). I plan  on getting a trunk mounted bike carrier for my car so I can go places.

I’m  trying to find a bike and from what I’ve read I’m either looking at a  “Hybrid” or a “Gravel” bike. The two that have caught my eye, if I’m on  the right track here, are the Checkpoint ALR 4 and the FX Sport Carbon  4. Both of these bikes are made by TREK.

What  do you all recommend? Or am I too big for these bikes? Should I be  looking for a different kind of bike? I have not climbed on a bike for,  like, 18+ years.

I started bike commuting to work in January. I had just a bit of cash and bought the cheapest used bike I could with all the money I had; that was a MTB. Fact is, my commute is primarily on tarmac. Although I was already doing a great track time going to and coming back from work (from the 5h bus daily down to 2h20min bike round trip), I felt the bike was too slugish and wanted to make it faster.

I can't afford a new bike, so changing from an MTB to a road/speed was out of the table. So I thought, why not just stick slick tires to it instead of the gravel tires I had? That oughta be faster.

I went online to search about it and 100% of the comments I saw about it, were demeaning to the idea. It's ugly, it's unnatural, it's wrong, just buy a road bike if you want to use road tires, that's imbecile... so on and so forth.

I asked the mechanic I took my bike to and he said ""well, you can put slicks on an MTB and it will go faster, but don't talk about that to any cyclist because they will be mad about it"". I asked for the tires to be swaped.

Then I started studying the course using endomondo so I could see where I was getting slower and where I was getting faster, and I noticed my speed drops around 5km/h on half the track; the sea side part where it's windy most of the day. Of course I noticed that when I laid low on the bike on these parts I strugled less with the wind, but it was uncomfortable as hell because I had to be curled up.

I asked the mechanic about using speed handlebars on my MTB and he said sure... you can, will cost you a bit, and there are bikes built that way for long distance dirt tracks, but way until I have one of these on my shop so you can test ride it.

Seems pretty sane to me, so I went online again to read about it. The same demeaning comments everywhere, ranging from ""it's stupid"" to ""you'll piss both road and mtb bikers at the same time"".

Mechanic offered me I could put arm rest clips on my bike, it'll be more comfortable to ride and will help me with the wind problem. I search about it on reddit, again, and guess what? More demeaning comments.

Whenever I said I commute on city with an MTB, the first comment was ""why not a road bike?"". I even got one ""you can't ride a MTB on city"". Well, guess I can, because I ride one.

Why are people so narrow-minded? That doesn't make any sense. Shouldn't bike be fun, comfortable and worth an alternative to cars/motorbikes? Why be demeaning to any idea except using a road bike on a road and a mtb on a trail?

Sorry about the rant, I just can't wrap my head around the idea of why can't I use whats more comfortable to me.",cycling,2020-04-18 16:25:42
1588538705.0,First 50 miler today!,"I’ve been cycling for about a month now and I’m getting the hang of it! Before quarantine hit, I was focusing on racing marathons and ultra marathons. I picked up cycling just as a casual hobby for extra mileage since I had a road bike laying around that I had only used once before and for some commuting. When I first started riding a little more seriously I was feeling some aches and pains, but now I’m starting to
get in the groove. Cycling may start stealing more of my running miles!

Today (Saturday morning) I made breakfast, got everyone out of the house, and then swapped out my shiny roller tires for a gummy new set of GP5000's.

65 and sunny. Spent 90 minutes on a 22.5 mile loop. 1,585 ft of elevation for which I was rewarded with 12 miles of negative gradients all the way home. That was my first real ride in more than 20 years, and it was awesome!

It was very difficult and I had to stop many times to catch my breath, but I made it! My partner waited for me at certain milestones. 

It was a great experience. At the end of the ride, Strava said I spent 56% of the time in heart rate zone 4. It was very tough.

I am a woman and I’m overweight. Going uphill I got so hot I had to strip down to my sports bra. Going down, I had to wear a puff jacket because it was cold. 

As I had to stop many times to catch my breath, fellow cyclists would ask me if I was ok, and when I told them I was just catching my breath they cheered me on. When they were passing me, they would say encouraging words. Even a bus driver who was on its way down even gave me a gesture of strength.

1657371521.0,Female cyclist receiving abuse,"I got a new E-Bike about 2 months ago and I'm absolutely besotted.  Previously I had a mountain bike which I enjoyed but given I live in a very hilly area and struggled with hills, I am definitely out and about a hell of a lot more now.

While there are always going to be drivers that overtake too fast or too close, or pull out without looking,  in the last couple of weeks I've experienced some really unpleasant antisocial behaviour, including having a rock thrown at me (which hit my leg) and being chased by a group of teenage boys.

Especially as a female riding alone, this has made me really uncomfortable and on those rides when I've experienced something horrible like that, has taken some of the joy out of having my beautiful new bike.  It probably doesn't help that it's a fairly girly step through Dutch style bike and quite distinctive, prime heckler fodder.

Any other women experiencing anything similar and any advice how I can toughen up and brush off these unfortunate incidents?

Edit: thank you for so many nice comments and the helpful advice. It's a shame that so many of us have experienced similar incidents. I live in the UK so carrying a weapon of any kind is not possible, but a helmet camera is a great idea and I will look into this. I also live in a nice area and the majority of hassle has come from teenagers and seems more opportunistic than malicious attacks but still feels scary when you are the target.

1592873400.0,Why Bike Shops are Sold Out Globally,"I've seen a number of posts regarding the shortage of bikes in the entry-mid level price point, and the most common reason I've seen cited is the recent surge in demand due to closure of gyms and good weather. 

I thought I'd put this post together to explain why bikes are sold out, and why you shouldn't expect them to get restocked this year.

The supply chain of the cycling industry operates in a very seasonal and cyclical manner. Typically, manufacturers of both components and frames design the next year's launches during the current year's peak season (June-July) and begin production of the following year's inventory in late-fall. 

With a good portion of the supply chain having manufacturing in Asia (eg. Shimano); the CoVID impact hit during their peak production months (Dec/Jan). This, coupled with shipping delays, led to inventory being very low going into the peak season for bike purchases (Mar/Apr/May). 

Pair the supply chain constraints with the increased demand from new cyclists, and you can easily see why the 2020 stock sold out almost immediately. 

Naturally, dealers are placing in orders with the manufacturers to restock inventory, but from the manufacturers perspective, they have already finalized their plans for the 2021 lineup. It would be inefficient for manufacturers to resume production on 2020 inventory when they are already gearing up to begin production on 2021 items; therefore, the majority of manufacturers have decided to give-up on filling this years demand altogether, and go full-steam ahead on launching their new line of products.

&#x200B;

TLDR: If you are in the market for a bike now, don't expect your LBS to restock on 2020 bikes anytime soon.",cycling,2020-06-23 00:50:00

My biggest ride until now was 69kms but today I set out to do what I thought would be 110 kms but eventually turned out to be 130(thankfully I rode with a group).

This ride turned out to be WAY tougher than I imagined it to be. It had crazy climbs and I wasn't able to keep up with my roadie buddies (I rode on a 17kg mountain bike). 

At the end I just couldn't keep up and noped out at 109, called a cab and treated myself with a sandwich and a cold coffe while I waited for it to arrive. I really wanted to complete the last ~20kms but I was also super proud of what I had accomplished. Did it in 5h, which isn't too bad I suppose :)

This ride also brought me a step closer to my (new) dream of bikepacking. It helped me prepare for it because I realized a lot of long distance riding is being prepared mentally. 

Anyway, just felt like sharing! I'm super happy about today's effort and am ready to work on myself, because I want to cross the finish line next time!

1621844424.0,Yesterday I was the bad cyclist.,"While doing my first 100km ride yesterday I was cycling along a shared cycle/pedestrian path. I got stuck behind a group of 6 cyclists riding 2 abreast in the middle of the path at about 12kph (8mph). They were wavering about a bit and when the rear two moved apart I got between them. One of them started to shout at me telling me to use my bell (which I took off when I was changing my bars and haven't been able to find). This alerted the rest of the group and I was able to squeeze through.

It occurred to me afterwards that if I'd clipped bars with any of them it could have brought us all down. I'm 43 and they were probably in their 60's so at the least it could have spoil every ones days at the worst really hurt people.

I always feel a bit of a twat shouting '""Excuse me"" or ""Can I pass"" and often get evil looks from people when I have. Maybe they should have been aware of other uses of the path and looked back every so often but I think they were all chatting away as it was a social ride.

Fast forward to about 6 months ago. (Im 25 now) One night, on acid, as I was looking at my character flaws,(if you've done acid, you know how good this can be). I had the realization 90% if my personality was sitting around a coffee table, smoking weed, and watching southpark. 

So the next weekend, I bought myself a decent older mountain bike.  It took me a while to get the motivation to get out there. Initially going for a cruise on dirt roads, or i would hit a trail on a saturday.  Then I started feeling better. 

All of a sudden, I was loosing weight. I was feeling better. My mood changed. I was riding after work 3 days a week and both days of my weekend. I even eat better now.  I truly feel like I found part of me that was missing. I'm starting to live for getting out in the woods.

1635265433.0,Had an angry driver follow me for a few turns yesterday.,"Just another drivers are the worst/be on the lookout/don't escalate story for everyone.

I was out on a ~10mile, hard effort type ride.  I had a slight tailwind and was going 20-21mph on a 25mph road.  There's a bike lane on both sides, wide lanes in the road, mostly flat, overall as good and safe a riding area as can be found by me.  

There's a small bridge at the end, and after that the bike lane tapers off and the road narrows.  Not super narrow or anything, and its only ~1000 feet to turn I take, which ends up being the main side road along the bayfront.  

A car passes me as I'm on the bridge and in the narrow section of the road that follows he starts braking and angles the front of his car to the right, across the lane, blocking the entire road and shoulder.  

I brake and since I can see that the oncoming traffic lane is empty, I go to the left around the car blocking the road.  As I'm coming up asking, ""Hey, you okay?"" because maybe this guy is having a heart attack or something, I get ""Get out of the fucking road!"" yelled out of the drivers window and he starts laying on the horn.  

I just hammered down max effort and turned the first corner and then the next one, you know, put distance between me and the angry driver.  It's all very short, dense side streets, with cars parked on both sides and after the second turn I noticed that the car is following me and when he saw me, he started honking and yelling again.  After another two turns, there's oncoming traffic and there isn't enough room for two cars, so he had to stop while I put some distance and another turn between us and I guess the presence of witnesses or the forced pause caused him to stop and reassess his road rage, because I didn't see him again.

Alas, I didn't set any PRs on the way home.  Don't get me wrong--good times between the tailwind and the adrenaline, and some big HR numbers, but no luck on the leaderboards.  At least I didn't get run over, though, so I have that going for me.",cycling,2021-10-26 16:23:53
1575378609.0,"No, you don't need a power meter","It appears that every week there's a post or two or three on cycling subreddits about power meters.

As a new cyclist, you watch some YouTube channels, some sponsored by manufacturers of equipment and will never say 'lol of course you don't need it'. They are all about power. Most cyclists don't have that much time to ride, so it's normal to try and get most out of the little time that you have. Again, you check some info, it's all about power zones and intervals and FTP. You want to measure progress and, of course, it's power because wind so obviously time alone isn't enough.

But it's not necessary. Not that long ago, power meters were new and out of reach for amateurs. Yet, amateurs were training just fine and got really fast.

If you want to measure progress, time on some segments is just fine. Sure, some days are more windy than others, but the trend over time will be clear. If you _really_ need to know the watts, Strava estimates are accurate enough to satisfy the curiosity most of the time. And if the times aren't getting better, just ride more and harder.

Likewise, you can train by heart rate just fine. Could you train marginally more efficiently with a PM? Probably. But it's not the limiting factor for most of the new cyclists. 5 or 10 hours a week won't bring you close to your genetic potential over a season. Most new riders are limited by volume. Any sensible training plan with a HR monitor will make you faster than you thought you can be, as long as done consistently and with a purpose.

Pacing the first century ride? By the time you're ready for it, you'll have enough experience to know what's your sustainable pace. It's not rocket science.

The point of my rant is: if you're new to cycling, just ride and have fun. There are a lot of companies trying to sell products to make you feel like some hardcore Olympian athlete. You're not, but that's fine, you can still have tons of fun and get faster and fitter than you thought is possible.

If you have spare cash for fun stuff, sure get one, it's up to you. But if you're unsure and it seems expensive, you don't have to just to keep up with the Internet cyclists.",cycling,2019-12-03 13:10:09

Don't ask me how I know this but please keep it in mind.",cycling,2021-06-03 04:38:36
1616315531.0,First Century!,"I did my first century yesterday! 30miles solo then 35miles with a friend and another 35miles solo. In the solo rides I averaged 17.6mph and with my friend I was down to 13.2mph (slightly pissed about it but that’s okay)! Was going for average power of 140w but only managed 130w, probably due to the middle section.
This is the first ride over 50miles I’ve done since November and I’m gonna keep the momentum going! Wanna do 100miles at 150w soon, will be done with some quality training! Feel free to drop any tips/training sessions for endurance riders.

Looking forward to my next big ride - 112mile (Ironman distance) ride on Saturday! :)",cycling,2021-03-21 08:32:11
1618852638.0,Has anyone else gotten dumped by their riding partner?,"Last year I was the stronger rider.  This year my partner is stronger at the start of the season due to their peloton training over winter, but I believe I’ll be back at 100% in 5-8 more long rides.  Last night they said we should ride independently, after complaining about how slow our last ride was.  Maybe I’m being sensitive, but I’m crushed.  I never thought of leaving him behind last year.   My riding partner is also my spouse so there’s that.  

Be honest.... should I just brush it off and go solo?",cycling,2021-04-19 17:17:18
1614920344.0,Almost bikejacked yesterday,"Denver here. Was on my way out of Union Station and noticed this guy was walking really close to me as I left in a somewhat poorly lit area; fight-or-flight kicked in and I blasted off on my bike and saw him sprinting after me, saying “get the fuck back here.”

Sorta traumatizing stuff... now, since I got a bike stolen in December (U-lock cut through in full daylight), and just got this thing, what sort of anti-theft devices beyond a lock are an awesome buy? I’m thinking GPS trackers, spy gadgety type stuff, even a lesser-known lock trick/model. I wanna see it all, because if I wasn’t fast as I was, I wouldn’t know what to do. I went through a million scenarios in my head of what I would’ve done if he pushed me off and stole my ride, and... I feel at a loss.

My bike is registered w/ police and bikeindex.

Edit: I do have renters insurance, but since I’ve made a claim recently, I’m worried they won’t pay out again if I report another theft",cycling,2021-03-05 04:59:04

1689347727.0,Advice for dealing with anti social people while cycling?,"On my ride home yesterday in the space of 30 minutes I had 3 separate incidents that I found to be annoying, 

1. Cycling on a cycle path there was a group of 6 guys walking towards me, well in advance I roll off the path to ride on the grass as I can tell they are in no mood to go single file, fair enough I’ll just go around, 
Cut to one guy faking to jump in front of me and screaming “WHEYY” and then another shouting “that’s not a mountain bike dickhead” presumably because I was riding on the grass. 

2. About 5 mins later I’m rolling down the worst paved road in history, feeling a tad stressed by the cheese grater road rattling my bike to pieces and a white van on my tail, when two (I’m guessing about 13 years old) girls are crossing the road, they see me, and start to slow their walk down on purpose, until I have to hit the brakes and go into the middle of the lane to avoid them, one shouts “bike wanker” at me. 

3. I finally get to my town and am rolling down the road. It’s a road with cars, houses and drive ways. A couple are walking in front of me bang in the middle of the road. I ring my bell in advance and slow down, they turn around and see me, they continue as they where. I ring my bell again at this point rolling to a near stop. They stop completely, turn around and the male tries to block me off as I go around them. 

I seriously don’t get why me riding my bike, carefully and considerately is upsetting so many people? I’m a 25 year old male and wouldn’t consider myself to be an easy target by any means, I’d love to retaliate and spit at them as I go past, stop and confront them, throw some fucking hands if I have to, but that would bring me down to their level and make the world a horrible place if we all act on impulse. But I feel like ignoring this behaviour just makes these people think that it’s acceptable. Is there anything I can do?",cycling,2023-07-14 15:15:27
1686780894.0,Blackburn floor pump lifetime warranty and customer service,"I purchased a Blackburn Air Tower 5 floor pump sometime around 2007. It was expensive, around $125, but that pump was the best pump I had ever used. About a week ago, I noticed the gauge wasn't working, so I contacted customer service through their website asking about the possibility of purchasing a new gauge. They contacted me the next day, asked for my mailing address, and said I would receive something within the next 10 days. Today, there was a brand new Blackburn Core Pro floor pump waiting at my front door free of charge. I just wanted to make this post to say I love their pumps and their customer service is amazing.",cycling,2023-06-14 22:14:54
1609114011.0,A Sub-$1500 USD Road/Gravel Bike Price Sheet,"I've been looking at getting a road or gravel bike in the near future. Though much of the decision-making process these days is down to ""I'll just end up buying what's in stock,"" I like to do research and figure out what makes the most sense for the money. 

So today I decided to put together a price sheet of all of the sub-$1500 road and gravel bikes that can commonly be found in your LBS in the United States. I left direct-to-consumer brands out, in addition to other international brands that can be had online through various avenues- as if I had included those, the list would be seemingly endless lol.

The sheet is sorted by groupset first, and then price.

Hopefully my Google Sheet to markdown conversion works. If not, [here's a link to the Google Sheet itself,](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bkBm3aCkgYQwmtlGbQgT4ATj7NLNARIoTgl44Uf6lCM/edit?usp=sharing) which has color-coding based on whether the bike is a road bike or gravel bike.

1641609790.0,horrible cycling experience,"Me and my friends went on a 70km cycling trip. All of us are completely beginners and I haven't rode a bicycle in 8 years. It was fine at the start until our destination, but it started to snow pretty heavily while we were eating lunch. By the time we were out the restaurant , the snow was about 5 to 10 cm deep. All of my friend left their bicycle at the bicycle parking and went home on a train because they were told to do so by their parents. So I went home by myself because I thought it wouldn't be that hard. I was wrong, my phone needed to be constantly charging because it kept going out of battery. At one point, I crashed because the snow was too thick and my cross bike couldn't go in a straight line and that broke the gear so I had to fix it in a sub zero temperature and it was pretty dark so I couldn't see it well so it took me about 10 minutes to fix it. I was able to fix it but I couldn't change the gears so I was stuck with gear 5. While fixing the bike, i unplugged the phone from the charger because it had 60% battery but it went out of battery in like 10 seconds. I spent the next literally 30 min shivering and waiting for it to turn back on again (I think the cold temperature broke my phone). I fell down multiple times after that and it was hard going up a snowy hill road with my cross bike so i had to push the bicycle up many times ( I spent about a total of 1 hour pushing the bike up hills). 

I almost collapsed few times but managed to make a 5 hour trip back home. I should have checked the weather report, and I might have died if I didn't bring a mobile battery charger. For anyone that's thinking about going on a cycling trip, make sure to check the weather report, bring a phone charger, and wear something warm)",cycling,2022-01-08 02:43:10

Cycling has provided me with a chance to get outdoors and stay active during the pandemic. When I realized how much I missed listening to my audiobooks during my commute since I've been working from home, I started listening to them on my rides (don't worry, I only use my right ear bud, so I can still hear traffic). Needless to say, cycling has been an amazing outlet for me this year and I'm so thankful for it!

On top of completing a metric century at a pace of 15.1 mph (24.3 km/h), I also finally finished my relistening of Oathbringer, the third novel of the Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson, during my ride today, just in time for the release of the fourth novel, Rhythm of War!

But question, do you just shave the stuff below shorts level, leaving you with a weird pair of hair shorts when naked?  Or do you go all the way up to groin level, for a beautiful set of smooth ladylike pins?

1603213616.0,How can I help bikers in my city?,"Hi all,

I work for the Little Rock (Arkansas, USA) Convention & Visitors Bureau, and in recent years cycling has been booming in our city. We've invested in new trails (both mountain biking and road cycling), and during COVID times, we've found that we get quite a few weekend visitors who are predominantly here to bike.

I'm now working on a new cycling section of our website that will list all of our trails. I think it would great to include the ability for visitors to download the GPX coordinates of each trail and import them into whatever app they use (Strava, RidewithGPS, etc.)

My question is two-fold: If you were visiting a new city, would you be likely to download trail info like that? And if so, is there a preferred software that you would be best to use? I've researched MapMyRide and PlotARout.com, but there might be a better option that I'm not aware of?

Any other ideas on how we can better serve our cycling visitors and residents would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!

EDIT: Thank you everyone for all of the feedback! I never expected this many responses and I appreciate each of them!

1588775863.0,Large Couple Seeking Advice,"My wife and I are large- around the 400lbs mark, maybe a little more? We’ve started our journey to a more healthy lifestyle and hopefully weight loss. I’m a super anxious hermit with social anxiety and a knack for avoiding the public. I’ve always dreamed of going bike riding but never thought I could at my weight, considering public opinion and logistics. I’ve decided that maybe it’s time to dive in and just go for it (maybe on some secluded paths) but I’m just not entirely sure what I’m supposed to be looking for when trying to purchase a bike? I think cruisers look more comfortable for me but my wife doesn’t really care as long as it looks cool and she isn’t “bouncing”. We also don’t have a ton of money for this new adventure and the only brand I could find that is made for large people (Zize Bikes?) are WAY to expensive.

I have so many questions! Is this even possible? If it is possible, what should we be looking for in bikes? Do people laugh at big people on bikes? Are we ridiculous for trying this? Any recommendations? Honestly, any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.",cycling,2020-05-06 14:37:43

https://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/tcr-advanced-disc-2-pro-compact

I’m buying this bike because some folks asked me to do the cycling portion of a race (Eagleman) which will be 50+ miles. I’ve never rode more than maybe 15 miles in a day and that was on a hybrid bike. I don’t know how much I’m actually going to ride after this race. I’d like to think I’ll continue,  but just not sure. I also don’t want to buy a bike which won’t be enough for the race. And if I do want to continue riding after this race, I don’t want to have to “upgrade” for a whole. But I’m feeling guilty about the price tag. Should I just go cheap and upgrade if I want to continue riding, or should I spend a little more to get a better quality bike on the front end? Thanks!

I recently graduated from college and had enough grad money to buy my own bike. The main reason I bought it was to bond with my dad. I’m a total daddy’s girl and after the pandemic I’ll have to move away, closer to my job. But I know cycling will allow me to say, “hey dad, wanna meet up for a Sunday ride?” and provide perfect bonding time for a few hours. Right now we do a couple hour-long rides a few times a week and he always tells me stories about his past and I see his dorky side, brought out by one of his favorite pastimes. 

Moving away from him will be hard but I can’t wait to call my pops up on a Friday and ask to do a weekend ride along the Northern California coast—just me and my dad. So, thanks cycling for providing intimate bonding time with my favorite person.",cycling,2020-08-06 06:11:38

 I asked about other brands.   He said ""Mate, there's next to nothing upto  & around £1000 in the UK at the moment.

1626013077.0,"I don't want to ""get off the f****** road"" (need advice about dangerous drivers in UK)","Over lockdown I'd (26M) started to take up road cycling in the UK. The past few months I have really been getting into it as the weather has improved. 

I'm a bit gutted though, as I'm not sure if I can continue cycling given the number of incidents I've experienced where dangerous drivers have acted aggressively (around 1 in every 3 rides) and have been very close to hitting me or running me off the road. I'm seriously concerned that one day I'm going to get permanently or fatally injured. 

The latest and worst event, which prompted this post, was today. A driver came within a few inches of me, aggressively revved ahead of me, then shouted ""get off the f****** road"". This was on a bend as I'd just came off a roundabout. 

It had been totally unprompted (i.e. he'd came from a different direction on the roundabout and so he had just encountered me... it was on a single lane 40mph road between two housing estates at 14:00). If I'd pulled out due to a pothole or something then I'm certain he would have hit me at speed.

I didn't get a good look at the driver and I missed catching his license plate, all I know was the area, rough time and that it was a Black Merc. 

I had a look online and Rule 163 of the highway code says he should give me as much room as a car, which he clearly didn't.

I really want to continue cycling, but I'm a bit shaken up. My questions are:

- What can I do to make myself feel more safe on the road, with regards to dangerous drivers? 

- I was thinking cameras might be a good way to catch these idiots and also could act as a deterrent. Has anyone found these to be effective? If so, did you use just one or more, and where were they mounted? 

- Should I report my incident to the police? I had a look online and it talked a little about uploading camera footage, but I don't have that. Given the limited amount of information I have, is it worth it?",cycling,2021-07-11 14:17:57

Those 4 miles felt like they were going to kill me! I had forgotten all about the impatient car drivers, the lovely bumpy roads and how little cycling shorts actually protect your undercarriage.

There’s my Car! It’s finally over, thank god for that! Wow I want to throw up... don’t throw up, there’s people around... water should help, just need a little drink.

1690285265.0,High-end bike manufacturing is a clown show - Change my mind (or share your experience),"Mostly hot takes/personal perceptions and I claim zero authority to be making these claims, so where do you disagree and where am I wrong?

* Bicycles are an unattractive global market - niche and no growth. They're unlikely to be well paid engineering jobs and a relative loser backwater compared to where the most talented engineers would want to work (e.g. semiconductors, automotive, aerospace).
* From a business strategy standpoint the only way to do well in a no growth niche market is to push pricing, try to go upmarket, appeal to hardcore enthusiasts who get a lot of value out of the hobby so would be happy to spend up to low five figures for a high end bike. Maximise that price discrimination/max willing to pay.
* Involves a lot of product tiering and gimmick R&D on lightweight/aero, a lot of spend sponsoring pro teams, influencers, whatever the latest fad is like gravel, or whatever else the marketing dept thinks will get you to buy X brand over Y or give in to N+1 and buy yet another bike surplus to what you actually need. This is a lot of what you're paying for
* UCI restrictions materially impinge on ""degrees of freedom"" in R&D and mean the differences between bike brands end up being small/irrelevant in the scheme of things. They're all more or less the same bike.
* Combination of needing to push price as the primary growth driver + being a non-entity in the competition for engineering talent and ability to reinvest vs more important /higher value sectors, result in high prices for relative clown show manufacturing
* As a result ""what you get vs what you pay"" for high end bikes proves to be an embarassing comparison with the same money spent on e.g. a motorbike, car, or the modern miracle of iPhones with chips that were fabricated with extreme ultraviolet lithography (insane science fiction stuff). Instead with bikes you get simple low tech commodity composites being molded into shapes where they can't even reliably get bottom brackets aligned correctly, and where industry going back to threaded over pressfit bottom brackets is marketed as a positive industry development rather than the total loser clown show inability to manufacture relatively simple things it is
* You'll probably spend the money anyway if you can afford it because you love cycling, but you're not getting any kind of good deal out of this.

1649546995.0,Bad advice often given to new riders,"•Carbon isn't everything, I've been riding for 7 years and have rode both carbon and aluminum. I am getting a new road bike and it will be carbon. Reason being, the aluminum version hasn't been in stock for 1.5 years and won't be shipped this year. Aluminum is often great value compared to its carbon counter parts.

• ""never go lower than 105"" is nonsense. I used Tiagra for over 5 years and would use it again. Reasons to us Tiagra as a new rider: 10 speed provides a great gear range, most upgrade wheels are 10 speed compatible, breaking a Tiagra component is much cheaper to replace than anything above it. I would buy a bike with Tiagra again (if they ever come back in stock)

• ""your fitness outgrew your bike"" really.... Just remember this, an entry level bike of today is much better than bikes that have won the TDF in the past.

I like nice stuff, I like stuff that's cool and performs better, but I would never tell a new rider that they need something they don't. The time I was happiest on the bike was with a used bike I bought for $800 (and thought it was a fortune at the time) and didn't know anything about components or wheels. Now in the present I own a road bike, gravel bike, smart bike and another road bike on order. Honestly speaking, I was the happiest out there when I just had enough to ride. Just ride what you got and its good enough.

Edit: many people misreading this post, it really has nothing to do with people buying expensive bikes. It has to do with marketing and word of mouth distorting what a new rider needs to enjoy the sport. To those who say this kind of advice isn't given to new riders, that is simply false. I was a new rider once and the benefits of carbon bikes and deep section wheels for example do not match real world performance. 

All I'm saying is, you don't have to break the bank to get into this sport .Also, the bike you have most likely isn't hindering your ability to have fun riding. That's really all I'm trying to say.

Edit: I am a designer by profession, I spend all my working hours and much of my non working hours designing things. I can appreciate nice cycling equipment and have purchased just about everything outside of the truly top tier stuff.

1567848353.0,Unpopular opinion: Top end road bikes are getting seriously expensive,"How far are companies willing to push their prices? Like, I obviously understand lots of money goes into R&D, testing and innovation but the prices right now for the top end road bikes are insane.

Take the S-Works Venge Disc with SRAM eTap for example = $16,000 AUD. 

This bike is likely to lose at least 30% of It's value the year after if you bought it today.

Some Pinarellos here are hitting the 20k mark. 

Bianchi's are mostly being made in China, but the prices remain high and the same.

If motorcycle performance vs. cost comes into consideration: 

For that price, you could buy a Yamaha R6 brand new here, that is made in Japan. A super sport icon in motorcycles that would accelerate faster than most vehicles. 

You could even buy a used Ducati motorcycle that was made in Italy for that authentic feel.

But the S-Works was likely made in a Taiwanese/Chinese factory. It's a great bicycle, don’t get me wrong, but is it really worth over $10,000? Are human powered bicycles with some modern components worth that value?

Heck, you could even buy a new car for that price.

It just blows my mind how far some companies in cycling are willing to push the boundaries when it comes to cost. I understand we have our passion in cycling and are willing to pay more, but the prices (be honest with yourself) are getting out of hand and I don’t think it’s fair as consumers that we’re having our dream bicycles become more unreachable. 

And whilst it’s true, a mid range bicycle tends to be the sweet spot for value (ultegra), I still don’t think it’s right to be asking for over $15,000 for a bicycle in some cases.

This whole situation reminds me of the iPhone dilemma with the price now all over $1,000 for any model here, yet the innovation of smartphones has stagnated. I guess that’s just down to consumer demand. 

We're not seeing some 'amazing new innovative design' come out in cycling, we still have the standard derailleur, chain and cogs yet the prices slowly, slowly gradually creep up every year under our noses.

When I left the house I had no route in mind and no idea of what distance I wanted to go. I trusted spontaneity and just .. went. I was intentionally not checking Strava and only used my phone to take a few pictures on short breaks.

Got home to find out I made it 47.7mi (76ish km). Set several PRs to boot. I was kicking myself for not checking Strava because I would have made damn sure I hit 50 miles!

My previous longest ride was about 27 miles. Today I did 47 miles. Now I'm eyeballing what it will take to do 100km and beyond! I love this sport. 8 months ago was was worried I'd have to stop biking completely.

As stupid as the comment sounded, I felt like the comment was made in jest possibly?  Is there some unwritten beef between Mtn bikers and road cyclists that I’m not aware of?  Or was this guy just a jackass?

Edit:  Well thanks for all the comments everyone!  It seems like my hunch at the time was correct and this guy was trying to make a lame joke….albeit a very weird one to make to a complete stranger.

I hit rock bottom from depression last year due to some pretty awful personal circumstances and was spending a lot of time in bed. I got a pretty nice (imo) budget gravel bike in December 2020 to motivate me to get out some as I used to ride my BMX ~10 miles, five days a week. It took a while to finally get some motivation to get out and I haven't been riding consistently until August (still not getting out often enough because of time, energy, and weather). 

There are a couple nice paved bike paths by me with, in the grand scheme of things, very insignificant hills. Maybe 150ft and 30ft of elevation gain a couple times on each one. These used to absolutely kill me. I would have to shift to my 48t gear on my 38t front ring to get to the top and I'd come out needing to catch my breath. I hadn't ridden them in a while because it was really hard to stay motivated thinking about riding them and getting so fucking exhausted.

Fast forward to this last week: I'd recently put a 44t on my front since I was spinning out on pretty lame descents. I did both of these ""climbs"" this week and, considering where I was earlier this summer, absolutely smashed them. I've got a bigger front chain ring, I only had to shift to my 40t gear, and by the time I was at the top, I didn't even realize I had gone up the hill.

1599054670.0,Has this happened to you during a crash??,"** Headsup, this post contains details of a crash **

Hi all,

I was cycling home from work last week and, out of the blue, a car drove over me from behind. I was riding a beautiful beast of an eBike called a RadRunner, and was wearing bright clothes and a fluorescent helmet with a red flashing light on the back. 

The driver was elderly and told a witness he thought he hit a traffic cone, so he carried on down the road dragging me and my bike with him. I was thrown clear after about 5-6 seconds of getting churned up, and the car drove on oblivious. 

Thankfully I’m alright.  Nothing broken, just a busted knee and some road rash which is healing up. I can’t quite walk yet, but I’m getting there slowly. The docs, nurses and people on the road who came to help were absolutely amazing, and none of us could quite believe how lucky I was. But something weird happened during the crash that I can’t quite figure out...

Just before I felt the back of the bike lift up, I got a really weird feeling. Like a spidey sense for a split second that something was off. I think I must have unconsciously clocked that the engine noise coming up behind me was in a different road position to normal.

As I lifted up, I turned in the air... and for a full 1-2 seconds, I wasn’t out there on the road. My brain told me I was turning on my side in bed with my cat... and I totally relaxed. I don’t remember hitting the deck, but when I opened my eyes I was being pulled along the side of the car, and I could see blue sky above. My shoe came off and I rolled clear into the verge.

I’ve never had such a clear moment of unreality like that before. It was like my brain knew what was happening before I did and totally took over. I’m sort of amazed by it!! Like it said, “hey, you - you need to relax and fall NOW” and it used a visual shorthand to get me to do it. 

Has this ever happened to anyone else? 

Stay safe out there and always wear a helmet,

1690796151.0,Road Biking is much more scary than any mountain biking I have done,"So, in May, I started road biking and moved from mountain biking (not enough trails and infrastructure for mountain biking in the UK). However, I have done some crazy downhills and edge rides in Europe. But none of that compares to how bloody dangerous road biking is. On a MTB I will only hurt myself if I make a mistake and I can minimize that. When road biking, many variables can result in me no longer being upright.

In my first two months, I had a dog run out of nowhere to take me out, managed to save the fall from damaging the bike but did have to get the rear derailleur re-aligned. I've had dodgy roads that try to buck me off the bike. I've had one or two drivers decide they want to either attempt to kill me or shout abuse (I must admit the latter can be fairly entertaining).

I first thought it would be relaxing (which it mostly is) but I find I have to concentrate way more.

Well today I was heading home on a downhill section, traveling at about 30km/h and I could hear a car behind me with a loud exhaust. I quickly glance back and see a blue car about 200m behind me. Within 2 seconds the blue car buzzes right past me, easily within one metre of me. It was honestly pretty terrifying but the best part is to come. 

I look up and see in the distance another car heading towards me. It immediately lights up with flashing blue and red lights and does a u-turn to follow the blue car.  I've lived here for about a year now and the first time I see a Police Highway Patrol Car is immediately after I get buzzed.

It was a spirited effort, but luckily I had a hell of a tailwind. Managed 1090 watts on the escape effort and 30.7 mph (yes I checked, because of course). I heard vague shouts recalling the pursuit, but they did not listen.

I avoided all other advise on dog pursuit other than go fast as hell... I was not going to get off the bike or attempt to spray with water.

Here is the dilemma, do I notify local park services about the animals? I have no issues with the unhoused finding shelter or having companions, but this would have been a different story had I been going into the wind. It seems a little dangerous to have loose animals. Am I overreacting?

1697149418.0,Awful Experience with The Pro’s Closet,"
TL;DR Their deals aren’t that good.  They aren’t going to look out for you.  It’s not worth the risk. 

I sent them an S-Works Aethos ($14k bike new), which got damaged in shipping.  They acted like jerks on the phone, blamed me for being “deceptive”, refused to help, and sent it back within 30 mins.  

Now I’m facing a significant carbon frame repair bill, no bike to ride, (a repaired carbon bike that will probably never sell), and I’m out a ton of money.  

What absolutely kills me though is the tech said, “this happens all the time”.  Really? You have people send you bikes that cost more that a lot of people’s cars, and you have to send them back damaged?  That seems just awful… and like something you might want to work on!

Am I at fault for poor packing?  I don’t think so.  Their tech said, “no, you packed it really well” 

Glad they’re using the $40 million they raised from investors in 2021 to scale up their bad service, instead of maybe providing regional drop off service, using a higher quality shipping partner, insuring customer shipments, or even just eating costs when unfortunate things happen… you know, “doing the right thing”.  

If someone from TPC reads this and would like to understand more, please reach out.  I’m happy to share my experience and be constructive.  You apparently record your calls.  Everything I’ve said above can be verified.  I have photos of pre and post packing that confirm the bike was either damaged at your facility or in shipping.

EDIT: Shipping/Insurance - TPC sent a shipping label that I used. They claim to insure the shipment, but are refusing to file a claim with the shipper since “the box wasn’t damaged”.  I have no way to verify this, since they sent the bike back in a different box.  I don’t have a relationship with the shipper since TPC is the shipper’s customer in this case.  I tried to get TPC to budge on this and they refuse.",cycling,2023-10-12 22:23:38

1578406560.0,In Zagreb (Croatia) you can now get your bike legally stolen by the city government,"Just had to share this with the world, because this is just too insane for words.

In 2017 Zagreb was deemed ""6th most bike-friendly capital in Europe"", according to a portal called ""Euronews"".

What a laugh.

While I understand that cyclists in other countries meet with their share of hostilities while simply trying to use their bikes for commute or recreation, Zagreb is possibly the most hostile place to be when it comes to the attitude of the city and government towards the cyclists. Not only is the cycling infrastructure in Zagreb all but non-existent (despite the mayor boasting about over 200 kms of cycling tracks, in which he actually counts in the hiking trails on the nearby mountain), but the police force are routinely doing what they call ""preventative action to ensure traffic security"" which entails camping on one of hundreds small gaps in a typical Zagreb bike lane, and then giving you a hefty fine for ""driving outside of a bike lane"". Cyclists here literally have to organize themselves and report on police sightings, because trying to get from anywhere to anywhere in Zagreb on a bike is technically illegal, unless you plan on getting off your bike and pushing it every 100 m or so.

But in a recent move from Zagreb's mayor which reaches realms of absurdity as yet unseen, a law was introduced where it is now legal for the city to literally take your ""incorrectly parked"" bicycle from anywhere within city limits. Not only is it not defined what an ""incorrectly parked"" means in this context, there is also a small fact that Zagreb does not even officially have places where you can ""legally"" park a bicycle - even if you find a spot supposedly intended for leaving your bike, most of those are in the form of those dated iron spirals with narrow hoops which make it impossible to both park and lock the bicycle in a way it would be safe from theft. So now if you tie your cycle to a nearby tree or street sign, which practically everyone does simply by necessity, cities' commonality workers will simply cut your safety lock with a circular saw and steal your ride. If you want it back, you will need to pay a hefty fine (over100 euros) in the span of 30 days, after which you lose the right to get your bike back.. but first you have to do some detective work and find out whether your bike was stolen by thieves or the city, because as of now the city of Zagreb does not provide any way of figuring out where the legally stolen bikes will be stored, what is the contact number or address to check for your bike etc.

So essentially a word of warning for all you cyclists who plan to visit Zagreb on vacation... you should not be afraid of bike thieves illegally stealing your bike, but rather those sanctioned by the government. :)",cycling,2020-01-07 14:16:00
1696284471.0,Absolute last word on carbon wheels for clydesdales,"I am a clydesdale (220lbs/100kg). If it matters, it's not because I am muscle bound. No, it's because I'm middle-aged and a little doughy around the middle. I'm the guy that other cyclists pass and say ""You've got this!"" and ""Don't give up!"" as the group ride heads uphill.  For this and other reasons, I have never seriously considered buying carbon wheels because I thought it would be embarrassing and wouldn't make any difference for my 15mph rides. But, recently I was in need of new wheels and found a used set of Dura Ace wheels at Mavic Aksium prices. After verifying I was within the weight limit, I shelled out the cash. 

Fellow Clydesdales: They made a difference! My first ride (\~30 miles) was almost 2 mph faster than when I rode the exact same route the previous week with heavy stock wheels. I set 8 PRs out of 10 Strava segments--and I had ridden all of them many times previously.  I even cracked into the top 10 of a (slightly downhill) Strava segment.

1598284775.0,Rode my first century on Saturday and I still like bikes,"It’s official, I think I caught the bug. Here’s my story in case any other beginners find it helpful:

I bought a Trek FX3 (flat bar hybrid) in May like millions of other impulsive people in the US, and got into it very quickly. After doing 500+ miles in July for no good reason other than it being a Strava challenge, I (again impulsively) registered for the Trek 100 Ride for Hope. 

Unbelievably, my friends and family donated $1,500 in support of my ride to benefit research against children’s cancer, despite everything going on in the world. My people are awesome. 

On Friday, the day before the ride, I was dismayed by a forecast calling for scattered thunderstorms all day since I’d never really ridden in rain. 100+ degree heat, sure, but not storms. I posted to Reddit (link below) in a panic asking for advice, and this community gave me confidence to go for it.

I finished the ride in a little over 8 hours including breaks and stoplights/stop signs, 103 miles total. The stormy part was the most fun part. The post-ride feast was epic.

To others who haven’t ridden a bike since childhood: you can totally do this. To the experienced cyclists out there: I’m coming for your PR (maybe once I’m in better shape in like 5 years)! Thanks to random internet strangers for the invaluable advice and confidence boost.

Just wanted to stop back and give a quick update for everyone who has been cheering me on. On May 4th I weighed 249.4 pounds. I started dieting that day, and started riding on the 5th. 

Today is the 24th, and I’ve now ridden ~205 miles this month. Today I completed my first 50 mile ride in nearly a decade, and it whooped me, but felt so good. As of this morning I’m 236.8 pounds and I feel like a million bucks compared to 3 weeks ago. 

There is no going back! I am shedding the fat suit once and for all. 

Thank you to everyone who has supported me so far! If any more of you wanna follow along on strava, here’s a link: [My Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/57012623)",cycling,2020-05-24 22:14:42

1568427464.0,Motorcycle to bike commuting what I thought was interesting!,"So I come from a background of motorcycles been riding for forever! Well I wanted to get in better shape and stay on two wheels so I bough a specialized diverge sport Carbon. It’s awesome best ride ever loving my commute even though it’s a little long (21 miles each way)

But man oh man! People in cars do not give a flying f about cyclists. I was always careful on my motorcycle and I thought oh cycling won’t be much different. Wrong.

People do not see you. Or even realize that a bicycle in a bike lane is a possibility. People pull out too far and block the bike lane when trying to turn. They look left and right for cars but not for bikes. Cars will literally pull out right in front of me as I’m going 20+ down hill. I’ve never been scared of crashing my motorcycle but holy cow, I get stressed on the bike.

1552708075.0,PSA: do not flip people off,"I learned this the hard way. Some people will retaliate. People will actually try to run you over. I live in Missouri. The conditions are as bad as they seem. I was riding on a two lane road when this elderly gentleman failed to go into the other lane to pass me; instead, he nearly clipped me. I instinctively gave him the bird. He didn't take to that kindly.

He stops in the right lane with traffic behind us. I try to pass from the right. He drives onto the curb. I try to pass from the left. He gets too close. I tap his mirror. 

He starts peeling out. I close my eyes and brace for impact... Nothing. I hear his window roll down. ""You dumb mother..., entitled cyclist trash..."". You get the idea. This happens for two miles. He then tried to explain to me, mid-trying-to-run-me-off-the-road, that my tapping his mirror to be askew caused it to break. He starts holding up traffic. 

Shit starts getting real. The road just turned to one lane. It was getting dark. Then this beautiful and courageous soccermom cuts off the old dude. She rolls down her window and tells me that she has been recording and that she is calling the police on him. She would not let him pass for the next 5 miles. Between when she interveined and when I got into the next little section of my commute the old guy dissapeared. 

I am still pretty shook. He told me that he couldn't wait to see me again. I travel on bike almost exclusively, on the same route. I am also very easy to pick out because cyclists are rare where I live. 

The moral of the story is: stop the situation before it becomes a situation. If you do do something in retaliation of someone making an unwise choice on the road, be aware of the consequences, and make sure you know your rights. I guarantee if I would have given the man a pamphlet with the laws of the road and a smile, he would have been far more receptive to my presence.

1627510488.0,"(Follow-up) ""Hit by car, bike destroyed, driver's insurance adjuster wants purchase receipt; I don't have one. Best course of action?""","Hello folks.   

Original thread here:   

[https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/m6pwjq/hit\_by\_car\_bike\_destroyed\_drivers\_insurance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/m6pwjq/hit_by_car_bike_destroyed_drivers_insurance/)

`""As the title starts to explain, I was hit by a car recently, and my bike was destroyed. The driver's insurance accepted liability. I provided photos of the damage, and an ""insurance assessment"" from my bike shop, for which the shop described the amount they feel needs to be awarded to buy a bicycle on the same level as mine. Let's say that amount was $2,000 in case it needs to be referenced.`

`The insurance adjuster wants to pick up the bike (that's fine, I guess), and they want to know when the bike was purchased, and the original purchase receipt. The thing is, I bought it used probably about five years ago, and definitely do not have the receipt. Does anyone have experience in this situation? Shouldn't the assessment from the shop be enough? Can the insurance refuse to pay if I don't have a receipt and can't get in contact with the original seller? Any guidance is greatly appreciated.""`

I did zero follow-up, and I'm sorry about that, especially since you all were so helpful.   

 A huge thank you to all who contributed. I should have included more context originally. I actually already had a lawyer, but the lawyer wanted me to handle the property damage side of things since they don't take any cut of that, hence that thread. They were originally handling it, but once the Geico agent started getting weird with it, the lawyer asked me to take over.

I sat on this for a very long time, worrying that I would be outflanked by an insurance goon, but finally got up the courage to push back. I can't remember VERBATIM what I said, but I kept it VERY simple, based on comments from this thread (especially [/u/TheBabyEatingDingo](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheBabyEatingDingo/), and my notes for the call were as such:

""Receipt: I don't have it, but the MSRP was $3,700, and the current version of it is $3,600.

This is property damage, and I understand I am entitled to the replacement value of my bike.""

They didn't put up a fight, although I ended up settling the property damage side of things for about $200 less than what I asked for (so basically my replacement helmet and phone screen repair weren't covered) just because I wanted it settled sooner than later.  I was moving cross country at the time, and just had too much on my plate, otherwise I would've fought for it.    

I'm still waiting on the medical side of things. Thanks also for all the well wishes. Happy to try to answer any questions for anyone curious, especially if you are going through something similar.

1597046638.0,"When you were new to cycling, what stories do you have about your inexperience? Here is mine!","Being new to cycling can be quite daunting when things don’t go to plan, but that is the nature of cycling! So I thought it would be a good idea to share our stories from when we were every new and made a lot of mistakes and what you learnt from that. Here is mine:

When I was very new to cycling (had been out on my bike a few times, doing max 10 miles) I decided it would be a good idea to cycle to my girlfriends house in the next city over, it was a 40 mile trip but I thought it can’t be that bad because I can easily do 10 miles without feeling exhausted so how much harder could it be?

The route I planned looked simple enough so I set off. What I didn’t realise was that the route I’d picked to avoid a motorway took me through all these tiny villages that were incredibly hilly. I hadn’t done much hill cycling at this point and it completely destroyed me, to the point where every time I saw a hill I had to get off my bike and push it up the hill because I just couldn’t make it up (I later learned how to efficiently change gear for inclines which I wasn’t doing on this ride so that didn’t help at all). 

A couple of cyclists coming the other way stopped and asked if I was okay, and I had to sheepishly tell them I’d bitten off more than I could chew. Very embarrassing!

I eventually stopped at a little shop and got something to eat because I was starving (also didn’t realise how much energy cycling consumed at this point, and thought I could do the whole trip without stopping for refuelling). After I’d eaten something I felt a lot better and carried on to my destination. I turned up at her house, sweaty, smelly and with shaking legs. 

Despite having to walk my bike up about 5 hills, I was proud that I had made it and I had learned a lot from my ride! 

I didn’t attempt such a long ride again for a while but instead did the sensible thing of building up how far I could go each trip out and now I do laugh at the memories of that journey!",cycling,2020-08-10 08:03:58

The results-it is totally great. Yes, shifting isn't amazing perfect, but it works find and the gears them selves are really nice. Coming from a fixie, and before that an old 80's schwinn with not well maintained original tube shifters... this stuff is amazing. It works fine, it looks great, it feels so light. 

I think for anyone on a budget, or who want something they know they could afford to replace if they bash a part, or whatever, Sora is great. I think maybe a lot of you on this forum who push 105 don't realize how totally ok Sora is.

1548878142.0,I have never felt the rage of a thousand cyclists until yesterday.,"Last night as I was driving home in my car on a small residential road with a designated bicycle lane on each side, I pulled up behind a car that was signalling to turn left and waited patiently. When up comes a large silver truck who doesn't slow down at all and blasts past at 35 mph in a 25 mph zone in the shoulder/designated bike lane. It wasn't like he was distracted and had to swerve into the lane, I watched him in my rear-view mirror and he purposefully drove into the bike lane to pass some cars and save himself 5 seconds. 

&#x200B;

The fact that he went around made me mad, but what really, really made my blood boil was after the car in front of me turned, I saw a little boy, probably around 12 years old, riding in the bike lane about 50-75 yards ahead. That kid had to have been very close to the truck when he blasted past us. Man, I started shaking, the anger was unreal. I caught up to him and gave him the bird and he just did a [puppet talking thing with his hand](https://media.tenor.com/images/2d3213bc8de1d9085e69d16660b80fa1/tenor.gif) like ""Yadda yadda"" type of talking hand. He pulls up to a stop sign and moves over and rolls his window down. So I pull up to him, roll my window down and yell at him ""You almost fucking killed a kid on his bike back there. Are you kidding me?"" And this 40 year-old lawyer-looking dude in his big silver truck that looks like it's only ever been a commuter vehicle just looks at me like I'm an idiot, and does the little puppet talking hand thing. And then slowly rolled away and kept doing the talking hand thing out the window as he drove off. I could not believe it. I have never seen anyone be so careless about someone else's life, much less a child, just to save 5 seconds of their commute.  I was shaking in anger for a good 15 minutes afterwards.

1590500864.0,I rode 138 km (85mi),"Hi all!I did my biggest bike-ride on friday and wanted to share.

Two years ago i was a 22 year old 180kg (396lb) pile of flesh. I wasn't happy with my weight/lifestyle so i bought a bike and sat on it semi-regularly.

At first i could only ride 3 to 5 kilometers ( 2-3mi) but shortly after i managed to do longer-ish rides (\~15km) and i was happy. From then i started commuting to work. The commute is about 7 km one way and leads me to the train station where i took a train to my actual workplace 35km away. From then my only mode of transportation was by bike and soon i could ride 30 km. After i did a few longer rides i had a breakthrough.I commuted the whole way to my workplace which is about 44 km. The first time took me about 3.5 hours and i was nearly to exhausted to work, but i did it.That was at the start of last year and since then i've upped my game and started to ride more. In may 2019 i rode a tour of \~70km and thought that my limit was reached.Boy was i wrong.I did the 70km route a few times now and since January 2020 there wasn't a week where i've ridden less than 100km. I've also lost 20 kg.  I wanted to ride this \~138km tour since i bought my bike and had it mapped out as early as the 70km one.Last Friday i finally did it.

I've gotten up at 4:30am and started at 5:30. I cycled for about 2 hours before i had a flat. I hadn't packed any tools and my only way out of this was either getting in a bus or going to a bike shop. The Shops didn't open until 9 am so i waited 1.5 hours and i wasn't on the road until 9:30. I decided against the Bus and continued riding the remaining 90km.After 40km it became so hard.My legs felt fine but my hands and feet hurt so bad. In the last 20km i rode 5km just to get off the bike and walk a few hundred meters so my hands and feet had a break. With 4km left it started to rain and i got drenched. After i got home i took a shower and noticed that some of my fingers were numb. They regained ther sense in the coming 2 days. And everything was fine.

I cycled for about 8 hours with an average speed of \~17km/h, had a forced break of 1.5h and semi-planned breaks of \~2 hours because of hand / foot pain. I drank 6-7 litres of water and ate 10 cereal-bars.

Even if i felt like shit for the last 40-ish km i caught myself thinking about doing it all again in the next few weeks. And hopefully without a flat. If you have any recommendations against hand/feet pain let me know! My pedal-bearings broke and i've ordered some clipless pedals and shoes. Maybe a fixated shoe with a hard sole solves my feet-problems. My next goal is a 160 km route to a friend with some hills in it, but until then i'll do the 140 km tour a few times more.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  
Thank you all very much for the kind words. I appreciate every single one of them. I'm looking at padded gloves right now and will probably order a pair this afternoon. I hope you understand that i cannot reply to every one of you but i will give it my best shot!

1614197821.0,Do you miss the excitement of your early long-distance cycles?,"Hi all,

I was looking through my old trips on Strava and found the route I planned out using Google Maps years ago before I heard of Komoot or anything like that.

I was intending to cycle from mine in South London all the way to the [Uffington White Horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uffington_White_Horse) and [Wayland's Smithy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland%27s_Smithy) to Swindon Train Station. 

I was a complete noob at long distance cycling, having cycled solo to Brighton twice (in successive weekends because I enjoyed the thrill). Both times I used Google Maps which took me slightly different each time - once via [Ditchling Beacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditchling_Beacon) and the next weekend via [Devils Dyke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_Dyke,_Sussex). I was so full of excitement that I just had to do it again the following weekend. 

Bearing in mind I don't own a car, so this mentally was a weird experience with psychogeography going so far you cannot turn back. I am also despite my relatively successful attempt at being an adult (proper job, Masters degree, own a flat, was married), I wouldn't say I was ever grown up - I am still very much a kid at heart - I have been called adorable on a few times despite being in my late 30s.

My Uffington White Horse route was even weirder and longer experience. I estimated about 130km without detours, but I have now looked and would have been 150km, nearly double my trips to Brighton. I followed the winding [Grand Union Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Union_Canal) out - which maybe wasn't the quickest route because of people, the tight path and the surface conditions - and like I say, it winds extensively, like a river.

I got seriously messed up by blocked paths and apparent impossiblity to cross under the M4 near Maidenhead. It was a mixture of flooded pathway and a blocked cycle path, so I doubled back maybe as much a dozen times until I had to just give up and go on a main road. On the way I also discovered the [Jubilee River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubilee_River) which is an artificial river channel that was designed to reduce flooding that wasn't on my map.

The weirdest point was when I crossed the gloriously beautiful town of [Henley-on-Thames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henley-on-Thames) and entered the [Chiltern Hills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiltern_Hills) and that's when went quiet. I didn't see or hear a soul for maybe an hour, passing these silent villages and then down a 'bridle way' that was no wider than the width of the bike. I thought I was lost. It was full-on bucolic England, so green and beautiful it was almost painful to look at. It looked like something out of the Shire in Lord of the Rings.

I finely descended through a pine woodland and passed through a small, but equally beautiful village of [Wallingford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallingford,_Oxfordshire). There I had my lunch, charged my phone and watch on a battery a pack and watched a wedding occuring in the nearby church. The lunch sadly didn't recover my energy - I had already crossed a 100km by that point and had to bailout near Didcot and take the train home.

I can’t jog. I can’t swim very well because of my shoulder. I can’t hike. I can barely walk a half mile most of the time before paying the price.

In New York City, where 19 cyclists have died so far this year in crashes compared to ten in all of 2018, bikers staged a mass die-in protest in early July in Washington Square Park. A lot of factors have contributed to the bloodshed, including too many cars, distracted drivers, piecemeal bike lanes, and more cyclists on the roads. Yet despite the efforts of many American cities and towns to make neighborhoods more walkable and bikeable, people are increasingly fearful of riding—or even running or walking—around cars.

It’s very difficult to merge on the bike lane in the highway since it’s right next to the “enter freeway” lane. It takes me more time to pedal uphill and to get in my lane and for some reason car drivers feel the need to honk every single time they feel like their time is being wasted. They honk when I’m in my own bike lane. They honk when I take .2 seconds to start up at a green light. Same with crosswalks, as if it would make the time go faster.

I’m making this post because of incidents that have happened to me over the past few months, the most recent just 40 minutes ago. 

I’m sure we as a community all understand fundamentals of biking safety. Hyper-vigilance, mental fortitude in risky situations, predicting the movements of other bikers and drivers, etc. These are all incredibly important pillars of staying safe on the road, and I respect fellow bikers for committing themselves to the safety of others and themselves. 

However, you cannot have reasonable expectations of others. You can never set a ‘bare minimum’ because there will always be someone in a car who makes the worst possible mistake and catches you off-guard. 

Maybe they don’t look both ways at a stop sign. Maybe they don’t even bother to stop, there will be no warning when they do something extraordinarily stupid and dangerous. 

It is on *us* to be prepared. 

So don’t get complacent, always expect the worst from drivers. Because any complacency can lead to tragic results. 

Stay safe.",cycling,2022-10-21 20:16:11

With just the small lights on my bike I was making my way down a long straight hill at a decent speed when something hit me really hard on the left arm. A bit like being punched, but by a child.

With the poor visibility I thought I'd possibly clipped a tree branch or something so didn't think too much into it.

Roughly a minute passed and I could feel my arm hurting a little accompanied by a strange sensation. I glanced down at my arm and got the shock of my life. There was a bat wrapped around my bicep with it wings outstretched. The airflow was keeping it pinned to me.

I don't mind admitting I screamed out loud  and then it just disappeared into the night.

So much for them having sonar...

Anyone else had any unfortunate encounters with nature whilst out riding?

I've been riding on average twice a week. 

I can't really run - I have a whole host of hip and ankle issues that really don't do well with the high impact nature of running. The low impact nature of cycling has really seen me embrace cardio training like never before.  I'm yet to regret a ride and I've had little to no DOMS from riding too. 

That said, I definitely made mistakes on this ride - issues with nutrition and pacing but I'm really pleased with myself for pushing through. 

I now just need to wake up earlier so I can get my rides in before work - I'm historically a night owl so anything pre 7am is a struggle for me. 

Looking forward to matching today's effort again soon, but tomorrow will definitely be a recovery ride.

1690313026.0,Used camera footage to file a criminal complaint today,"Riding through a small village headed home a huge dump truck from another township passed WAY too close to me and then pushed in even closer once he was fully abreast, felt like he was trying to cut me off or even push me to the curb.  Had to slam on my brakes to avoid crashing and maybe going under the wheels of this 60,000lb (don't really know but it's bloody massive compared to me) vehicle.  

Varia RCT715 on the back, Cycliq Fly 12 Sport on the front.  Got the town logo, vehicle ID, license plate, even a semi-recognizable shot of the driver's face in the truck's side view mirrors on video.  

Village police seemed to be on my side.  They took the complaint, said the video footage made it pretty clear and that they agreed with my interpretation of the situation, that I had the right of way in that location due to narrow roadway, etc.  This was just today but hopefully there will be some action taken.  

I deal with a lot of bad drivers, as any of us who ride on the road do, and I don't run to the cops with every little thing.  This is the first time, in fact.  But for a professional driver driving a gov't vehicle to take such egregious and dangerous action against a cyclist was too much.  My son has a CDL and says this guy could lose his if he gets a ticket for reckless endangerment (what the police were saying) and it sticks.

1613136811.0,I made an app for planning cycling tours and weekend trips and wanted to share it with you amazing people!,"Hi all!

I'm a cyclist myself and I mostly ride long distances on weekends but I've also done a couple of bike packing trips. Each time I started planning a new ride or a long trip, despite there being some great apps like Komoot, Ride-With-GPS, Strava etc to plan a route, I just wasn't satisfied with them, especially their mobile app experience of creating new routes.

  
Being an app developer, I thought I'd solve this myself. So I built my own take on creating new routes on the mobile. I present to you - Maplocs - A cycling route planner! You can get the app here (only on Android right now..)

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=abhiank.maplocs](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=abhiank.maplocs)

  
What you'll find different in this app from all others is that its purely built just for planning cycling routes; a pure experience with no fluff. It's powered by data from OpenStreetMaps. You can find routes for all kinds of bikes. The app comes with a slew of powerful route editing tools, like undo, reversing a route, drag and change point location, delete a point, closing a route loop, adding points in between and more!

  
However, I feel that finding a good route is just the tip of the iceberg. We all just want to have a great time riding our bikes and I feel that wind and rain often ruin that. Maplocs has just the thing to help plan around that. You can view weather along your entire route. The app shows temperature, rain and wind. Additionally, you can see the weather for any time in the future within the upcoming 7 days! This is one of my favorite features in the app.

  
My second favorite feature is one which I'm sure you all will love as well is - hills on the route. We all have a love hate relationship with hills. Wouldn't it be awesome if an app could show how many hills are there on the route? Well, look no further. The app shows hills categorised from Cat 4, Cat 3, ..2..1 and HC.

  
Now that you have the perfect route, you can share it to directly to the Garmin or Wahoo apps or export a GPX file. Also, all your routes are saved safely offline so thats its available to you even if you have no internet.

  
More than anything else, I just want to help my fellow bike packers and weekend riders to find great routes and just have an amazing time on their bike which is why I want more people to use this app. I shall be more than happy to receive any feedback and share any promo codes if anyone wants to try out the premium features.

  
Thank you for reading :)  
Abhi  


Edit - Thank you all so much. I am extremely grateful for such an amazing response from such a passionate community of cyclists. I have tons of feedback and new ideas to work on now.  
I still have a few promo codes remaining and will be more than happy to share. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Thanks again!",cycling,2021-02-12 13:33:31
1668321944.0,Longest ride of my life today. 44 miles on my friend's e-bike with the assist engaged but it was still 4 hours pedaling.,"I used to ride my bike all day as a kid. Loved it, then got sedentary as a teenager and got fat. Up and down the scale a bit and after high school, the weight got packed on then some came off then seesawed for years until adulthood and stayed fat. Got up to about 315 lbs at 5'6"" and stayed a while. 

I live in NJ and my best friend has been in California for a few years now... Six months ago I was out visiting him and he lent me his e-bike to ride along with him on a fire trail in Malibu. 

A month later I bought a hybrid bike and my first day with it, I was huffing and puffing but did 3 miles and said I couldn't wait until that seemed like a warmup. I started riding more and more, and got my kids into riding with me. All summer we pedaled around town and on the local canal path. We worked our way up to a 25 mile ride. 

They went back to school in September and my frequency dropped off but I'd make up for it on the days I went out on my own... I'd say ""ok let me go out and do 12 miles just to stay in shape"" and do 17, 25, 18... Maxed at 28. 

I'm back out visiting my friend, down over 50 lbs from where I started, and today we did 44 miles. Over 4 hours in the saddle. I know I couldn't have done it without the e-bike assist but I was putting all I had into it the whole ride.",cycling,2022-11-13 06:45:44

I was thinking of reducing the resistance to use yellow or blue springs instead of red on days when I’m sore (sore legs are the main thing). Outside of that, I’m not sure how else to reduce the resistance. I do know that doing reformer more will reduce DOMs, but I don’t want to overdo it.

I also feel that reformer hits my arms and legs more than abs; I think that mat Pilates hits my core much better, especially the TVA. How do you get less of a leg burn and more of an ab burn?

I've heard about Feldenkrais from another pilates instructor who is also an actor and I think that is how she found out and learned about it. Her voice changed noticeably and she did an AT method I don't know what sort of witchcraft she just performed but it was profound. I was also encouraged by a choreographer to learn Feldenkrais on top of Pilates.

But unlike yoga and the rising popularity of pilates, Alexander technique and Feldenkrais seems so obscure. When I look them up, Feldenkrais in particular, it makes no sense to me and it seems a bit woo woo. I took an online group class session and didn't notice anything particular, it felt like we just doing basic stretching movements on the floor. But the people who regularly practiced it swear by it. Maybe my older more fragile clients might find it useful.

I was thinking of learning them in case it adds to my Pilates practice, how I carry myself, and what I can teach my clients, and wondering about the experiences of others who also practice these other modalities.",pilates,2024-02-26 12:25:39

Here are things people say to me when I am the only guy in a Pilates class:

Are you here with someone

Bring more of your guy friends

Do you know other guys who want to do Pilates

You look like you do [sport X], I bet you do [sport X]

You know, Pilates was designed for soldiers

You might want the eight-pound dumbbells

You’re strong!


All of this is fine. Some thoughts:

— When I’m the only guy there, I worry that it looks like I’m a creep who is in the studio to gawk at women.  That’s the biggest psychological obstacle.

— Yes I have guy friends, and they go to the gym a lot, but Pilates would be a hard sell because they think Pilates won’t train their muscles as effectively as weights, and they may be right about that.

— I like Pilates because it’s a change of pace from weight training, the core workout is great, and the reformer is wacky and fun, like if Le Corbusier and Joe Weider got drunk together and said “let’s design something that has leather, and sheepskin, and you work out on it.” 

— Joseph Pilates’ method would have fallen into obscurity if not for so many women adopting Pilates and keeping it alive by becoming students and instructors, and also Joseph’s wife Clara basically kept his business afloat before and after his death. So yeah, a guy designed it 100 years ago, but the reason it’s down the street from me today is because women made it a big deal.

They assured me over messages that they cater to absolute beginners, but while I was excited at first, now it's the night before and I'm terrified! 

My baseline level of fitness is at an all time low - I've been extremely sedentary for the last 18 months, and honestly I've never been very strong, coordinated, or flexible at any point in my life. Is it awkward to be such a total newbie? I feel like everyone who recommended pilates to me already had a pretty good baseline of fitness from sport, running, or strength training, so now I'm scared I'll just be totally incompetent.

I think Pilates would be great for her. I was going to give her my aeropilates if she goes to a class and decides it’s for her.

I could hook my foot around the foot bar and return no problem but it would have been great if it would return like it was supposed to. It’s usable just not great.

1708616911.0,My Feet.,"Hello! I'm thinking about looking into pilates as a way to help correct my feet. Right now, my heels are not properly aligned with the rest of my foot - pronated, I believe - and it's causing some problems.

Both podiatrists I've been to said to just get arch supports, but I have a difficult time keeping them in place. Insoles are proving difficult for me because my feet are so wide.

I got to thinking about, if all I really need to do is correct or ""reactivate"" my arches, then certainly there's some exercises I could just *do* instead of trying to find the right product or have some invasive procedure done that could potentially make things worse.

There's a place nearby that does pilates and physical training, but they're pretty expensive, and I don't think insurance covers it.

So, I guess what I'm really asking is - what do you all think? Do you think pilates can help with this? My understanding is that it helps with alignment and strengthening, so I figure as much, but wanting to get more information before I start fanning out hundreds... What am I getting myself into, here?

Any insight you all could share would be greatly appreciated. :)

1708607546.0,I wish there were even more benefits,"To give background, I absolutely love Pilates and have been practicing at a classical studio since November. I recommend it to everyone I know. I say it’s helped my core and I love the methodical rhythm of classical Pilates especially, without needing to literally work my body into the ground. I am already quite strong (heavy lifting background, having been doing that for 10 years so have packed on quite a lot of muscle) and flexible (intermediate to advanced yogi of 3-4 years). I am a certified PT. 

I have been moving away from aesthetics-focused working out into more low impact exercise in the past few years. I used to lift 5 days a week and run 3 days and now I do Pilates 3x a week and yoga 4x. I throw in lifting 2x week if I have time. 

Classes are expensive. The benefits of Pilates, I’ll admit for me, are mostly core-based (I now have a much stronger core than when I was only lifting or only doing yoga - I neglected my core a lot and got injured several times doing heavy lifts as a result) as I find yoga more helpful for my flexibility overall. However, the way this sub and others tend to describe Pilates as it CHANGING THEIR LIFE. I want Pilates to change my life too! But I feel like I’ve only seen my abs pop a little more but otherwise I haven’t noticed very much change in overall strength and flexibility. 

I want to continue but classes are expensive and it’s getting harder to justify renewing my package at the studio. Can anyone 1) let me know of ways Pilates has changed their lives so I can be more mindful and see these changes for myself as well? Preferably NON-aesthetics based as in general I’m moving away from exercising for aesthetics, it wasn’t healthy for me before; and 2) recommend alternative ways other than in person at the studio (which I still think is the best but perhaps I can mix up cheaper alternatives)?

should i keep going on consistently, to make progress, or is this just not for everybody.

Overall, I have lost 35lbs. For the first time in my life, this weight loss has felt completely effortless—I’ve so far been able to maintain it for about a year now. 

I don’t want to get into a debate over which form of exercise is best for you, because I do feel it is person-dependent. However, for someone like myself who has a very high-stress lifestyle at baseline (night shift ER/trauma RN), I’m 100% confident that Pilates is the secret sauce for me personally.  

Just wanted to share with y’all! Would love to hear from others as to how Pilates has effected their lifestyle as well 🫶🏻",pilates,2024-02-20 15:36:43

1708391170.0,Signed up for a reformer flow class and 85% of class was off the reformer.,"Is this normal? 

Background: I  attend Core Burn and Equinox group and privates in NYC. I happen to be on Long Island for the week and signed up for a few Club Pilates classes. We started on the reformer doing legs and feet and then quickly moved to the floor and wall tower. Then we used the box on the floor and more wall tower. I was actually annoyed since I have limitations and getting on and off the floor and grabbing springs isn’t easy for me. It took me months to master the reformer logistics due to neck and shoulder issues.

Is it normal to advertise a ‘reformer’ class and only do about 5 minutes total on the reformer? 

She instructor saw I was annoyed and she told me I can go back on the reformer and she would instruct me what to do, but she didn’t and what the rest of the class was doing on the floor did not translate to the reformer. At the end of class she said she does all different types of classes. At this point I just said thank you and left quietly.

Oh and the instructor was very eager to tell the class that the moves she was telling us to do we would definitely ‘feel’ tomorrow. Never in all of the instructors that I’ve had in the city drive to make us hurt the next day. What the heck lady.",pilates,2024-02-20 01:06:10

Also open to any advice.

Be advised, if they use ""Pilot"" for the shipping, you will be lucky if you get it on time, it is not damaged and if you get any communication from the company at all as to what is going on.

Mine was due Jan. 8th, after much complaining to BB, calls, emails, etc., if finally came Feb. 8th.

It came damaged (scratched). See prior post.  Items that were suppose to be in the box and on the reformer to protect the reformer were missing,  The box was destroyed, so I assume those pieces were tossed, at some point in the journey.  These are huge.  135lbs ish.  extremely long.  I wish they would separate the parts, so it wasn't so heavy.

They did not send someone that was physically fit to take it up a flight of stairs but they did get it up there with much difficulty.

Ask yourself, if it is a month or two late, is the OK?  Look up Pilot reviews.

Ask yourself, if they get injured or your property gets damaged while delivering and taking it up stairs, who is responsible? Look up reviews

Ask yourself, if they take it up the stairs and it is damaged (especially if you do not realize it until after they leave), will you want the hassle/nightmare of returning it and getting another one? Especially if your delivery is a difficult one.

I am 64 years old, a lightweight and cannot muscle the reformer around, let alone up and down stairs.

I would advise, to make sure whoever you purchase your reformer or other large equipment from, is not using Pilot.  Look up reviews, on whoever they ship with.

**Do a Google search for Pilot shipping.  So a search here on Reddit for Pilot shipping.   Tons of people stating items don't show up, extremely late, damaged.  No communication.  Look at images of the freight.**

1708090642.0,Pilates Breathing Helped Me With Other Exercise Modalities,"When I first started taking Pilates classes, I was struck by the focus on controlled breathing.  In through the nose, out through the mouth.  Expand side rib cage on inhale.  Sync breathing with flow of movements.

I have no idea (because I was not aware of it) on how I *used to*  breathe when running or weight lifting.  I suspect in the former I was sometimes hyperventilating; with the latter, unconsciously holding my breath at times.

Nowadays I always control my breathing Pilates style to ensure efficient oxygen intake to power my body! With running, I am able to bring my heart rate lower and run faster for longer duration.  With lifting, I can go higher weight or reps - having learning to inhale on the release and exhale on the exertion.  In both cases, my control of breathing helps distract me from thoughts of ""quitting"" the exercise too early, better enabling me to mentally go the distance.

1708041032.0,For the men who do Pilates (and fellow instructors).. what did your instructor do to keep you engaged in the beginning?,"I’ve been teaching full time for over 6 years now. I primarily deal with pain clients, special populations, and post rehab clients. And I’ve recently started private sessions with a new guy. His background is super heavy weight training.. but only upper body since anything lower body exacerbated his pain issues. In fact he has a lot of pain, movement, and immobility issues so we’ve been starting slow.

 Trying to get him to stabilize and correct his form has been challenging. I find it difficult with him since he really feels it should be super hard and sweaty to feel like he’s getting anything out of it but he doesn’t want to slow down enough to learn to do the movements well. I want him to move better but not be bored out of his tree.

1707992321.0,Benefits of Pilates for a Healthy 22 Year Old Female,"Hello!

I've been debating whether or not to start paying for pilates classes as a healthy 22 year old female. Currently I weight train 3x a week and run 3x a week (on the same days: Monday, Wednesday, Friday). I am looking to add pilates since so many people talk about the benefits such as better posture, less back pain, more body awareness, etc... However, the classes are not cheap, and since Im already doing other form of exercises + yoga once a week, I was wondering if the benefits of Pilates are worth it. Will I be able to see any physical changes? And if there are physical changes, what will they be? Thank you for taking time out of your day to help me!

Also, I have been seeing the pilates vs lagree debate. I know plenty of younger people around me suggesting lagree since they see better results, and get more ""toned"" since the classes are a lot more intense. However, on the other side, a lot of pilate individuals will tell me lagree is bad for you. It seems like theres so many information on the internet that I don't know what to believe.

1707972992.0,Brand new Pilates instructor here. Worried about having my fellow instructor sub for my clients,"I am pretty new to teaching, and I have a few regulars who see me weekly. However I will need to take a week off for surgery next month, and then in April I need to fly out of the country to my pregnant sister in law so I can be there for her during birth and take care of her after for 3 week (I am the only family member she has who can do it).

My coworker, who is a more experienced Pilates instructor and already has a pretty booked schedule, is willing to sub for me for the four weeks total. She's a good mentor to me and we get along, but I am worried that if my clients work with her, they'll see how much better she is and how I seem inexperienced in comparison lol and switch to her, or feel disappointed with me afterwards. She's been teaching almost 10 years. I've only been teaching 2 months!

I do think that clients can tell if an instructor is doing a good job or not. I have an instructor I go to (who is also like a mentor to me) and I noticed a big difference between her (teaching for like 20 years) versus someone who has been teaching for 5 years.

1707954845.0,Update on delivery noted in another post:,"Update: The shipping and delivery ended up being an horrible ordeal (much more than an inconvenience). They shipped with ""Pilot"". Every review platform has them with an average of one star ratings. Horrible rating. Freight destroyed, missing, late, no communication, etc. I could go on for days. It did not leave the freight company for about a week past when it was suppose to.... ok, not that big of deal. Was estimated for Jan. 8th. Then it sat at local freight company without any communication, scheduling or return calls for another couple weeks. Then they show up with one person and was going to just drop it in the snow covered yard, because no one told the guy it was an indoor delivery and needed two men to carry up the stairs. He said, well someone dropped the ball on this. He drove away with my reformer and then more radio silence. Had no idea if it even made it back to the original freight company warehouse that night. I asked for pictures, the boxes were destroyed. I was going to refuse delivery but BB said they confirmed it was not damaged. Finally they delivered it. They had taped all the boxes back together. Several pieces missing that protect the shipment. No bungee cord to hold the carriage during shipping. The shims just hanging off the side and not where they were suppose to be. The large foam pieces missing. I am actually surprised it was not in worse condition. Balanced Body is a 9 hour drive from me. It left BB December 29th and I just received it on Feb. 8th. Bottom line, one leg is pretty chewed/scratched up. One other scratch on rail. One of the men appeared to be elderly and not a good choice to help another guy struggle up the stairs. BB is sending me paint. They reimbursed me a portion of my inside delivery fee for the ""inconvenience"".

Needless to say, if it wasn't for the incredible equipment, I would have cancelled the order.

My account manager was great, and she felt bad for the situation. The equipment is some of the best on the market, obviously.

I asked why they would ship it with a company that has a horrible reputation? You can look anywhere and Pilot is probably the worse for shipping something. She said if they shipped through FedEx or UPS, it would cost a ton more considering the weight and size of a reformer. They have to use smaller companies.

I feel like I was basically trapped. The leg that is all scratched up, is in the corner. No one will see it. To have them come and get it and replace it, I am sure would have been a nightmare. Seems wasteful and a ton of lost revenue for BB.

Frustrating to pay several thousand dollars for something that is scratched up, having to need to paint so that it looks decent, and to have that delivery mess.

I have thought about a few other pieces of equipment from BB, but I will have make sure it will be guaranteed to be shipped from another company or I won't purchase again.

Currently, my workout routine looks like this:

* Strength train with dumbbells at home for an average of 35 minutes, 5-6 days per week.
   * 3x legs, 2x upper, 1x core
   * My dumbbells range from 5-52.5 lbs
   * I use FitnessBlender's workout videos/programs so am always following along with a video; sometimes, cardio is thrown into the mix
* Walk 10k+ steps (around 5 miles) 5x per week
* 1 rest day/gentle yoga

I'd really like to throw pilates into the mix but am unsure how to approach it; I've done pilates before, typically as part of other workout routines, but never focused on incorporating it into my routine on a weekly basis.

Do you do strength and pilates in the same day or keep them separate? Like, 2x lower body strength, 1x pilates lower body strength, etc? Is there as much of a lower body/upper body separation or do you incorporate more ""total body"" days?

She then proceeded with a device called “AO Scan Technology” which then provided reports related to charka, food i was allergic to, places I had problems with and so on..

1707487255.0,Why is the weightlifting community so triggered by the rise of Pilates?,"I’ve really enjoyed adding Pilates to my fitness routine. But as Pilates has gotten popular, I’m seeing a lot of fitness influencers look down on it and say that weight lifting is superior.

I’m not sure if I’m imagining it, but because Pilates is seen as a “feminine” and “soft” type of activity, people think the exercises aren’t as good or effective as “masculine”heavy lifting.

I don’t see why it has to be a zero-sum game. I personally do pilates alongside martial arts and it’s a really nice mix.

Also women who don’t want to lift heavy, shouldn’t be forced to feel ashamed that they don’t want to? It’s just a weird vibe I’m getting where women are being shamed to lift heavy or else they’re not “truly” into fitness.

1707472416.0,Struggling with exercises on my side & planks - hypermobility,"Hi everyone,

I’m still quite new to Pilates, I’ve been doing it on and off for about two months now. I really enjoy it, but I’m not seeing any results yet unfortunately. 

I workout at least four times a week, whether it be a 30 minute workout or a 20 minute workout. Is this okay to do? Will I see results from this level?

One thing I really struggle with is exercises on my side. I also really struggle with planks. 

I’m 22 and I am diagnosed with hypermobility. My shoulders and arms are quite weak and I think the reason I struggle with planks and side workouts is because I cannot support my weight on my arms. I have had my shoulder pop out of its socket before (this is a regular occurrence to me because of my diagnosis) whilst trying to do this.

I’m mainly focusing on toning my core at the moment as I am aware I have a very weak core, but whenever I follow videos on YouTube like move with Nicole, there’s pretty much always some form of planks in there and I genuinely cannot do it, my back ends up hurting and my shoulders feel like they can’t support my weight. I am working on my form with planks etc but it feels like no matter what my form is like they cause me some degree of pain. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to do these exercises? Do I need to focus on arm workouts for a few months before I attempt these kinds of things again?

I do only do Pilates, with walks a few times a week. I’m not overweight but I do want to get the stereotypical ‘Pilates body’.

1707439647.0,“Don’t do yoga breathing”,"Hi all, 
Just had a great private class with a relatively “tough” instructor who I’ve taken small group classes with mostly in the past (3 ppl max). I’m an avid yogi so when I breathe I breathe expanding my entire diaphragm and when I’m doing hundreds I try to make sure I have enough breath in the tank so my tummy tends to puff out quite a lot especially right after my inhale. He didn’t seem to love that, he kept telling me to expand my rib cage instead and keep my powerhouse engaged and scooped. However when my powerhouse is properly engaged and scooped and my ribs are in this is generally on the exhale (when I’ve got no breath left). Like I’m squeezing out ALL my air to knit the ribs in. How do I keep that engagement while breathing in? 

Can any instructors enlighten me as to the preferred “proper” way to breathe - even though I know most teachers here have just said to breathe and not to think too much about it?

1707412548.0,Worst reformer Pilates class of my life,"I purchased a pass of 50 sessions of a yoga and Pilates studio based in Australia. I have been going to their yoga classes quite often but they’ve recently opened up a new studio which includes reformer classes, so I went and tried a few times and really enjoyed it as I was able to work out my muscles and build strength.

However today I went to a new class with an instructor I haven’t met before and arrived early to inform her of my shoulder concerns that my physiotherapist advices for me to not overuse or strain it. She said she understood but during the entire session it was mainly shoulder exercises and I felt so much strain. Despite struggling a lot and wanting to give up and leave because I don’t want to cause further harm to my shoulders, the instructor only helped once at the beginning to modify an exercise for me by giving me a block to lie on for a plank-like exercise, however for the rest of the class there was no help nor corrections for me nor any of the other students’ forms. There were only 4 students in the class and my previous classes had more yet were not this terrible! I’m still quite new to reformer Pilates so I’m not sure what to expect but I’m quite traumatised.

Now it’s 4am and I still cannot fall asleep due to the strain on my shoulders and frustration. I want to cancel my pass however the studio policy states no refunds for cancellation and I’ve already paid for 50 classes so I’m really at a loss of what to do. The only reason I didn’t walk out of the class at the beginning was because it was paid and it was a small class of only 4 students and walking out would have too awkward.

1707353619.0,What are the benefits of pilates?,"Hello everyone, sorry, I'm sure this question is already asked often. 

Some background information:

I'm 19F who is very skinny/slightly underweight. This has always been a huge problem for me. Not only do I want to gain weight and be more confident in my body (I've always been called a stick and a skeleton, so I've always wanted more meat on my bones, especially in the glutes, legs, arms... so everywhere lol), but also for my health. I have a condition called Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. Long story short, I'm a musician, and my nerves/muscles in my arms are damaged. I'm supposed to do stretches assigned from PT to help open up my shoulder area, which will help release pressure off of my nerves. Also, although I'm skinny, I am VERY unhealthy. The most exercise I do is walking since my campus is very hilly with lots of stairs. But that's it. So I eventually want to do weight training, but I'm VERYYY weak, don't have any flexibility (I'm taller than average women, so I can't reach my toes or bend a certain way, stuff like that). 

I was wondering, what are the benefits you have noticed with pilates? What areas of your body have benefitted from it and have noticed a difference in? I eventually want to do weight training, but I fear it may be too much for my body to handle because I'm so weak and not used to pushing my body at all. Do you guys think pilates is a good way to train my body to working out, improve flexibility, maybe build some strength, and then move on to weight-lifting?

1707333895.0,So I did my first pilates mat class today.," 

So I did my first pilates mat class today.

I hesitated a bit because I'm quite fat, inflexible, and quite weak, but I really want to improve all of it, so I just went for it.

I really liked the class, but I felt really weak, and I was unable to reach the ranges of motion of many exercises, but I did my best!

I started an active life about a month ago with my diet, with 3 gym days for weightlifting and some aerobics. My big goal is to lose 77 pounds, be active, more flexible, and have less pain in my body.

But except for working with weights, which I really like, I felt very ""weak"" in my core and very unflexible, which made me feel bad about myself.

And I read here in some threads and on the web that pilates can help me with that. 

My plan is to do pilates once a week now, along with my gym sessions and aerobics.

Is pilates once a week enough to make the change I want? Is it okay that I felt I did not do well in most of the exercises?

BTW, why are 90% of the people who do pilates women? I don't care who practices next to me; I have a lot of female friends, and I don't care that women are more flexible than me by far; it's a fact. I focus on myself only, but I must admit, it's felt a little weird. (Maybe because I used to practice sports that connected more with men in the past.)",pilates,2024-02-07 19:24:55

1707311199.0,This is not real pilates,"I want to talk to you about this. How is the boundary drawn for something to be considered Pilates? You might say, if it follows Joseph Pilates' Contrology method, then it's Pilates; if not, then it isn't. So, how do you explain the concept of 'modern Pilates'? There's a certified Pilates instructor named Margaret Elizabeth, a very sweet person, and her way of marketing her brand is to say, 'Other instructors are marketing something that is not Pilates in an unethical way.' Margaret claims that her Pilates is real Pilates, while many others are charlatans. According to Margaret, Pilates consists of traditional Pilates movements like teaser, hundreds, done slowly, and with a maximum of 8 reps. And this woman does Pilates with Courtney Miller on Pilates Anytime (I can find the link if you're interested). Courtney Miller, on the other hand, teaches classes on Pilates Anytime that include movements like jumping lunges, which she herself says in the description, is hiit kind of pilates. So, is this still Pilates? By the way, Courtney Miller received her training from Stott Pilates, a highly respected school. And in this subreddit, Lia Bartha has been discussed as a very good Pilates instructor many times before. Lia recently shared a reel saying that what she does is not Pilates but an original method inspired by Pilates. And she's right because if we define Pilates as only traditional Pilates, then what Lia does doesn't fit. Blogilates received a lot of backlash for years for not doing 'Pilates,' but what she does is not much different from some of the respected instructors on Pilates Anytime who also mix in barre and dance and do Pilates faster while calling it Pilates. I hope there's no misunderstanding; I just thought that what the instructors say contradicts each other, and I'm quite confused.

Pilates is in no shape or form easy and I learnt that the hard way. I don’t know what the previous studio was doing but after my second one I know which studio I’m going back to (and the instructor was really great as well)

Halfway through the session I even had this thought ‘no wonder people who do Pilates have great bodies’

Now my legs and core are a little sore and I’m looking forward to more sessions. Time to be a Pilates girl ✨ (but not the kind that looks put together while doing Pilates. More like the kind that almost falls off the reformer)",pilates,2024-02-06 02:11:43

1707073404.0,3 Weeks of Mat Pilates Before and After (See full text for description),"For background, I (23F) have been dealing with back pain for the last 6+ years. I used to run track and cross country in high school but once my back started to hurt I quit once the season was over. Doctors told me it was anxiety, shoulder problems, disc herniation, possible arthritis, but every test came back normal. The pain was so bad I couldn’t lift my arm above my shoulders or turn my head completely. My last visit my doctor told me all they could prescribe me was pain management. About a month ago I read about the benefits of Pilates for back pain and figured I’d give it a shot since I felt like I had no other options. 
3 weeks later and I’m never going back!! Home pilates 3-4x a week has started to change my posture and along with mindful eating, I’m already down 5 pounds. This week was the first week I’ve been pain free in more than half a decade.

People who have considered becoming an instructor: what do you want to know about? 

Pilates Instructors: what topic do you wish you knew before beginning your training?

1707007550.0,Is it just me or is what my(F) fellow employee(M) said weird?,"I am a pilates instructor, the other employee was a PT. He looks like he's in his late 30's and I look like I am early 20's. IDK if this borders on sexual harassment or inappropriateness, or if it's just dry humor. The thing is, we don't really know each other so we're not really even at a friendship level where we can get into edgy or raunchy jokes yet.

So we work at a high end gym, like $300/month. I was teaching him pilates, he is also relatively new to the gym but has been living in the area for years (compared to me who came in a few years ago). We talk about the different neighborhoods and the demographic of the gyms, like is it a younger crowd, older crowd, urban professionals with money to spend, are they families, who is our demographic, etcetera. Then he said the gym we are working at has a lot of ""sugar babies"", and I said ""how would you know they're even sugar babies? I assume they're just students"". I think it's a stretch to assume that any young woman who can afford this gym must be a sugar baby lol, she probably has a corporate/student discount or has a well paying job (probably both), especially since the male members aren't assumed to be riding on another's dime. He said ""yeah there are those too but a lot are sugar babies and there are trophy wives here married to rich guys. You know, a lot of these guys who come here can be good sugar daddies"" to me and his tone was pretty playful.

Like why are you telling me this lol we just met only for the second time ever. Is he suggesting I can find a sugar daddy here.

I have never been the type of person to work out more than 3x a week max so building a more frequent routine is really new.

I’ve begun incorporating strength training because that’s the only other type of exercise I’ve found that I enjoy (unlimited classes are too expensive for me at my gym so reformer classes every day aren’t an option), but I’m surprised by how sore that has left me. Pilates has stopped making me sore for the most part so I think I will adjust over time but am not sure how to navigate this transition period. When I’m sore I feel like my body can’t give its all in a workout and that sometimes leaves me frustrated not relaxed!

I am aiming for Pilates 3/4 times a week and weights 2/3x a week with one rest day. For those of you who do weightlifting/non Pilates based exercises and go to contemporary reformer classes. Do you have any tips for helping my body adjust to this new routine? If I’m too sore to really push myself during a reformer class should I just take a rest day or go to get what I can out of it?

I absolutely get that everyone is entitled to a bad day, but their classes are scattered and not always impactful. 

Today's class bordered on dangerous, with her having us do boat on the long box on a blue spring with one leg in the strap and doing various movements. Another part of the class were side planks with the feet on the foot bar. Three of the five of us were beginners and couldn't successfully do the workout. I am re-introducing myself to fitness and honestly, can't side plank very well on the ground let alone the reformer. At one point the teacher said, ""C'mon just lift up!"" I would if I could I promise. 

Would this be feedback worth sharing with the studio owner? Also I know everyone will say ""skip their classes,"" but it's just frustrating while I have an unlimited membership and they teach Fri-Sat-Sun so I have to squeeze all my reformer work outs into four days.

I started doing Pilates a month ago, but I’m feeling like my body doesn’t reflect the month of work I’ve put in so far. I know you need to build muscle and it takes time, but I feel like I’m not doing things with proper form, or maybe my workouts aren’t impactful enough.

I do Move with Nicole. I linked the video I do everyday here. I used to do one of her beginner exercises but then switched to intermediate level this past week. 

The video I have linked was one I did last  summer and it was very effective. I noticed great results. This time around, I’m not feeling the same way. Specifically, when she does the leg switches with the curls up, I feel as though I’m not doing those right and am only curling by putting my head up.

I would love to get a reformer for my home, but they are expensive.  However, the Pilates gym memberships seem pretty expensive too.  I could buy a reformer for the cost of an annual membership.  

I'm looking for some advice.  Is a home machine worth it?  If so, what machine?  (Keep in mind I am 6 feet tall).  Do I need to go to classes to learn how to use the machine or can I learn with videos? Any other advice for a newbie?",pilates,2024-02-02 17:56:48

1706824279.0,"Pilates cured my knee pain, and it feels like sorcery!?!","In my late 30s, due to a weak hip, I started to have some pain in my knee. (This condition is informally known as lazy butt syndrome, if I’m not mistaken.) It really acted up when I was running, so I had to stop. I've also had to be really careful in jumpboard classes. 

A few months ago I started doing weekly private classes with a teacher at a local studio. In our first session she immediately focused on the alignment of my knees and hips when doing footwork on the reformer. We’ve also be doing work that targets my lower glutes. 

After a few weeks of this, I was walking on the treadmill one day and thought to myself, “My knee has been feeling pretty good lately; what if I tried jogging for just five minutes?” Lo and behold, I did it! I’ve slowly increased my running time, and last weekend I ran for nearly two miles in the park, something I haven’t done in at least three years. 

I'm honestly kind of in disbelief because I did not expect this private instruction to be this effective, and so quickly. It almost feels too good to be true.

I fell in love with the method when I was in school, starting with YouTube mat workouts at home and then getting really into the classical sequence through Return to Life. I had never even used a reformer before when I decided to become an instructor. I went to a school in a semirural era so all that was really available to me was the giant contemporary franchise that gets a lot of flack on this sub, that I sometimes lovingly refer to as “Sam’s Club Pilates”. I live in NYC now and it’s my dream to teach at a real, classical studio. I am so passionate about the history, archival research, classical exercises and transitions, the foundational principles etc. I’ll take a very technical class with no music and four students that starts on the reformer and ends on the Cadillac and I feel like I’m on top of the world, and then it actually hurts my soul to return to my own studio where I’m paid a meager hourly to teach a class of 12 where everyone is just looking for a Solidcore-esque “burn”. I don’t think that redoing my certification would be practical nor would I be able to afford it, but beyond sitting for the NPCP exam I’m at a loss of how to get my foot in the door teaching in boutique studios!

The leg/arm start to feel really fatigued, and I don't know how to improve it and how much is it worth it.

My instructor said it's good that the muscle is fatigued, because it exponentially improves body resistance, and they said this to be the goal of pilates.

My abs have certainly gotten a nice shape to them now and I think I've made modest progress overall  but one thing I notice is I get the ""shakes"" so easily despite having 50 classes to my name.

It's the lower abs I think. There sre various exercises that involve them and I notice literally immediately they shake with each repetition. I can get through the exercise but I'm left wondering are they not being strengthened? Why am I so seemingly weak here still.

They taught this style at club pilates and my local Pilates studio. It’s not fast paced and I don’t usually break a sweat, but I do end up feeling sore.

I attended a reformer Pilates type course. This is a new place in town that I tried with ClassPass. For reference I life heavy, have been doing OTF for 7 months 4-5x a week. Running good mileage. Figured why not try it? Well while attending the class it was a lot of new people including myself. Well now that I am home (3hrs have passed) I am feeling pretty bad but in actual pain(knees, upper back between shoulder blades, IT band, hips). Even when I started OTF I never felt THIS bad. I felt my legs cramping a lot during the session. Chalked it up to it being a different kind of work out than what I’m used to. The instructor didn’t do the workout with us or show us modifications. She kept pointing people out and making them do the moves she was describing. I felt like someone’s actual mobility was not considered-mine wasn’t.

So exactly what explains this? These are guys who work out every day, they're pretty strong, large muscles. I am assuming that despite hypertrophying and targeting the big muscles that can do a lot of work, a lot of conventional exercises don't target the stabilizing and intrinsic muscles like Pilates does? And these guys are strong, but it's also a lot of extra weight for them to handle compared to women who are smaller. Another thing is, women's center of mass is in their hips and core, while men (especially muscular men) have their center of mass in their upper bodies. I've seen lean women who don't even seem like they work out that much seem to do certain exercises easily such as the short box series, the hundred, and footwork while the big guys struggle through them.

Maybe comparing it to online platforms now where the instructor will be doing the entire class with you. I did have an instructor who performed most the movements with us in-person and I did love her classes.

I first began with reformer, which - I know - is probably not ideal but it really kickstarted my interest in it. From there, I started working on complementing those reformer sessions with mat pilates and obviously saw a huge improvement! 

I’ve now begun considering an accreditation in pilates but still feel like such a beginner! For instance, I’m not crazy flexible, which I sometimes get tripped up about, so wondering if that’s a dealbreaker or not as well/how I can improve this with my practice. Ultimately I’m just wondering if any of you have tips on the next steps for me to really improve so I can feel confident enough to move closer to those next steps of eventually teaching.

Today I had a no-show and one who showed up 15 mins late — both booked by the studio. The studio software sends automated reminders but I guess that’s not enough. 

For those who are instructors how do you handle this?  For those who are students — what are your expectations if you arrive 15 mins late?  

I just checked the studio webpage and I don’t see any explicit policies about late arrivals or no shows. These were new clients so no payment info on file.

ETA: thanks for the responses, everyone. These were clients brand new to Pilates and to the studio so I think the owner is trying to attract new students by not requiring payment up front. I get it but it’s hard on an instructor.

1706379341.0,Pilates pays more dividends in more areas than anything else I've ever done.,"I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but I'll just go ahead and take the cheap likes and fake Reddit karma: I'm convinced that Pilates has more positive effects on everything else in my life than anything else I've ever tried. It's an aphrodisiac and an intensifier of sexual pleasure. (Not trying to make it awkward, but who wouldn't want this?) My juggling is instantly smoother and more graceful after a Pilates session--so much so that if I were about to perform on stage, I would probably do very little juggling but a lot of Pilates for my backstage warmup. My (very amateur) piano playing gets an instant boost--there's a Mozart song that has a part that I usually just keep messing up if I repeatedly practice it, but if I play the song shortly after a Pilates session, I can often nail it on the first try (but then I overthink it and start messing it up again, lol). I haven't been hiking much lately, but when I do go, I seem to have more energy, and feel more comfortable in the rhythm, than I would if I'd been just hiking all this time instead of doing Pilates. I'm sure the deep breathing has a lot to do with this.

If you're already pretty good at something, and it's really a mental block or faulty posture or a mind-body disconnection that's preventing you from getting better (as opposed to a lack of effort in the discipline), then a practice that directly addresses those problems can be better for you at this stage than trying to directly iron out the kinks--that's the opinion I'm forming. 

I really don't think I've ever done anything else that's as good for me overall as this is. It's such a shame that there's no chance of my ever meeting the man himself. ",pilates,2024-01-27 18:15:41

My main goals are to increase flexibility and mobility to compliment my skating (my hips are so fucking tight lol), as well as muscle + core strength. I also am looking to tone up and lose some excess fat; I have adjusted my diet for CICO as well as healthier choices + get plenty of cardio from my skating.

Hello! I am a newbie to pilates and have a few questions.


Background:
 i have experience with home
workouts and playing different kind of sports for cardio. I loved stretching and have a flexible body, got splits and all but left it when i got busy with life. Last year i tried those home workouts for weight loss and strength. My issue with them is i think my posture has become worst because of
(maybe) improper form. The focus on proper form is not enough and i don’t want to make my body worst instead of better.. searched about it and the issue with these workouts and not enough proper guidance  worsened postures and pains for many people.


My focus now: strength and toning my body,and i would love to incorporate weight training later ( lol want to do ego lifting) 


So my questions are:

• anything i must know about pilates and general guidance about it. Is the strategy correct to start pilates and incorporate weights later?

•beginner recommendations on youtube. For some reason i am leaning towards jessica but people really love move with nicole. I think jesica valant has more proper instructions but idk you guys guide me please. 

•do you lose weight with pilates? My focus is mainly just toning my body and gaining strength.

I would appreciate your opinion on the matter, I  just wonder how many studios today have real ""Pilates"" lessons.

I want to try Pilates too, but here is the problem: 

Almost Every studio I check about, I think this is not ""real pilates"".

I mean, Most of the instructors there, have done some fitness course for a diploma, maybe a gym course or general fit, maybe another ""pilates"" short course.

But most of those instructors do ""TRX"", Pilates, spinning, and circuit training.

I have no intention of disrespecting them, and some of them are good their classes can be excellent, but I wonder how many Pilates experts they are?

My low back is very quick to complain during anything lying down with feet in the air.

I started reformer Pilates last week and I love it. However, there’s a specific kind of exercise I’m not able to perform and I’m hoping you guys may have a solution? I have hip problems, 3 surgeries total, both hips are equally hurt. I am unable to lay fully on my sides to do any sort of leg exercise that requires that position. It is extremely painful so I end up missing out on that part of the class (the reformer cushion is not all that cushionnnnny lol). 
Is there any cushions, devices, something I can purchase to add extra cushion between my hip and the reformer so I can do the exercises?

1706144473.0,Do any of you combine Pilates with resistance training?,"I started Pilates a couple of months ago with no expectation of getting buff from it, but I find that the deep breathing combined with the total-body muscle activation often gives me an almost irresistible desire to strike while the iron's hot and do some heavier work--more like bodybuilding. When I do swimming or the double leg kick, for instance, I can practically hear my posterior chain crying out for a deadlift or a trap bar lift. And I think it would be so natural to flow into it--just maintain the bellows breathing and the thousand-yard stare, the total concentration, step up to the bar, and go. When the set's over, flow into an easier Pilates exercise (maybe the shell stretch?), continue breathing Pilates-style. You could do an entire heavy lifting workout with Pilates filling the long rest periods that you'd normally spend just sitting or standing around, or you could do straight Pilates until the very end and then finish off with just one set of an intense compound lift--make it really count because you know it's going to be your only one. Then you'd cool down with some easy Pilates.

So I’ve been an informal Pilates teacher for a while now, and last fall I began my journey to certification.

I currently teach once a week at my community center and I’m struggling with being comfortable to go around and correct people.

I don’t particularly love being touched, I did find it helpful when I was doing my mat 1&2 training to have the instructor help correct me with their hands, but I was uncomfortable.

Now, as an instructor, I notice people’s form is off, etc, so I try to give very clear verbal cues, but it just doesn’t always translate to someone. I think I just need to start giving touching cues (after asking for permission) and just keep doing it until I’m comfortable, but I thought I’d come here and see if any other instructors have the same issue.

1706098565.0,"Should I start Pilates at the start of my weight loss journey, or after I have lost weight?","Hi all,

I hope you're all well!

I just had a question as to when starting Pilates would be best for me in regard to achieving my goals. As a bit of background information, I am a 21 year old female who is slightly overweight. I am currently in the process of getting back into my weight loss journey. My ideal body goal is slim and toned.

I have heard that the point of Pilates isn't necessarily weight loss, but I would love to do Pilates as I understand that it helps in building strong, lean muscles, and doesn't cause you to look bulky. Of course there is nothing wrong with having larger muscles, but that is personally not the look I am going for.

In terms of weight loss, I understand that eating in a caloric deficit is one of the main components of losing weight. Besides controlling my caloric intake, I am also going to be doing cardio exercise to lose weight (walking, zumba, spin, etc.).

As the title suggests, I am wondering whether I should start Pilates when I start my weight loss journey, or whether I should start Pilates after I have lost the weight. I understand that the lean muscles in question might not necessarily be visible (the definition specifically) until the excess weight has been lost, but I guess I am mainly wondering if I start Pilates at the start of my weight loss journey, whether essentially as soon as I have lost the weight, then the toned muscles will be visible.

For extra information, the type of Pilates I would do is Reformer Pilates. If beneficial, I would be happy to incorporate mat as well.

1706047397.0,Why can't I lose my belly fat?,"**TLDR: I can’t lose my belly fat and have tried EVERYTHING. I am a 23 year old female, 110 pounds, 5 '1, very active (pilates 4x/week, weightlifting 3-4x/week, 10-15k steps/day), and eat healthy (15-30% caloric deficit, high protein, no simple carbs). Is my only option liposuction?!** 

**Background:**   
I’ve been “skinny fat” for my entire life and have always stored all of my fat in my abdomen. I have fat nowhere else- my arms, legs, back, face, etc. are all very skinny and petite. I literally only have fat in my abdomen- to the point that people have asked me if I have an illness or am “purposely sticking out my stomach”. People I have been intimate with have pointed it out as well, which always felt so humiliating and embarrassing. I never show my stomach and always wear extremely loose clothing to hide it because of how insecure I am about it. I started weightlifting when I was 16 years old with the goal/dream of fixing this. I’m 23 now.   

**What I’ve Tried:**   
I’ve experimented with every weight lifting split out there- PPL, Upper/Lower, Arnold, etc. I do 6 exercises per session, starting with my compound lift and moving into isolations. I train each muscle group close/to failure and increase my weight/reps every single workout. I do 2-3 weighted ab exercises at the end of each session. I warm up, stretch, and prioritize recovery. I’ve also tried incorporating other forms of fitness to help with recovery/for general health, such as pilates (great for stretching) and running/walking (helps my leg soreness). I also get 8-10 hours of sleep/night to aid with recovery.   

I’ve experimented with every diet out there- carnivore (1 year), keto (3 years), plant-based, vegan, etc. I tracked my macros for 3 years, so I know portion control/how much i’m eating. I’ve consistently been in a 15-30% caloric deficit for the past 3 years. I get in 100 grams of protein minimum daily, avoid simple carbs (white rice, white bread, sugar), and prioritize veggies. I stop eating around 7 pm and start eating around 8 am the next day. I don’t eat out EVER. I avoid salt in my cooking and only use olive oil. I’ve also tried all the supplements (Creatine, Alpha Lipoic Acid, L-Glutamine, Fish Oil, etc.)   

I’ve worked with 4 different personal trainers. I’ve created my own fitness programs and nutrition plans. I’ve actually studied to be a personal trainer/nutritionist (ended up pivoting to something else), so I have all of the learning material I need. I’ve successfully been able to counsel OTHERS on how to get a 6-pack and lean out, but I can’t do it myself.   

I’ve seen doctors about this- endocrinologists, PCP, GI. I did receive treatment for IBS and it hasn't helped. They all have no explanation for this. I was told that I do have a hormonal imbalance (low estrogen, high cortisol), but the provider I saw didn’t feel like treatment/intervention was necessary.   

Also should mention- my glutes are very small and weak. All of my leg workouts prioritize them, but I am extremely quad-dominant and tend to overwork them no matter what I do. I’m still trying to figure out how to “activate” and better isolate my glutes because I wonder if this could be contributing to my problem?   

I’ve been watching videos on liposuction and genuinely am considering this (when I have the finances), but the recovery is BRUTAL. I've also considered gear, but I don't even know how to get that. I am so sick of being insecure about this. Please don’t tell me I have body dysmorphia or that my stomach fat isn’t “too bad”- it’s something that will never stop bothering me no matter how much I’ve tried to accept it.

I’m 5’9 and I just fit in the A2 carriage. Cost wise I’m looking at either having to get the A1 or Rialto. On BB website, it lists the A2 carriage as 33” when you do the comparison and 39” on the description (I’m assuming it’s without and with headrest) and the studio as 30”. Does it seem right that the studio carriage is 3 inches shorter than the A2? 

Because then it says that A1 is 28.5, Rialto is 30 and A1 stretch is 34.5. So if all that is true than my only option is A1 stretch.

1705843398.0,Weak back? Weak abs?,"Hi all,

I’ve been following along with Move with Nicole’s. Videos a few times a week for about a month now, but I’m really struggling with anything where I have to keep my back “pressed into the floor” and bring the legs to tabletop or straight up and have to lower them at all. When I lower them, no matter how hard I try, my back strains and I can’t keep it pressed into the floor. At this point it feels like I’m doing something wrong mechanically or I my legs are so heavy that they are forcing my back to strain.

1705600812.0,"Solidcore/Megaformer/Lagree ARE NOT PILATES, and it’s important to understand why.","I see more injuries from patients attempting these workout classes than any other class.

This is why the (previously known as) PMA is so important to help to legitimize the level of training pilates instructors have prior to them advertising and working with clients. I wish there was a better overarching licensing body to help with this.

Solidcore, Megaformer, and Lagree are taught by instructors who have a weekend training module, sometimes 2 or 3. That’s IT.

It takes YEARS to become a comprehensively certified pilates instructor, and most schools require extensive anatomy education or additional coursework.

So yes, the distinction IS VERY IMPORTANT.
These alternative HIIT classes try to use the pilates name to gain popularity and are often taught in groups of over 12 clients! Can you find a class/instructor that’s amazing? Sure- but it’s still NOT Pilates.

We do not want to be associated with the lack of training, education, and injury-prone exercises that these HIIT classes facilitate.

This is why I get so frustrated thinking this is a Pilates subgroup and every single day I see multiple comments/posts about HIIT classes that are NOT pilates. At best they knocked off the equipment and franchise to try to capitalize on the benefit$ and indu$try of Pilates by offering something totally different- a HIIT class.

1705592172.0,Should I complete teacher training,"Let me begin by saying I've taken pilates classes for the last three years and have been struck by how pilates transformed the way I thought about and approached exercise. (I played soccer my entire life until college and dealt with some injuries that prevented me from running which was my primary way of exercise before pilates.) I've spoken to my past teachers about training and they encouraged me toward it. This year, I was about to pull the trigger to take a mat pilates certification course, but am having second thoughts. I love pilates and want to teach other people about pilates breathing and how low impact exercise can be helpful to life. (A part of me believes this is just imposter syndrome since I may be ""good"" in class, but that doesn't mean I'll be good teaching a class.)

But I'm worried that it may not make sense since I don't view Pilates as a full time gig (I'm a journalist by trade and originally wanted to teach 1-4 classes a week). Does it make sense to go through training for mat pilates if I don't intend to transition full time? Especially with the costs of training (in my case it's about $600 for mat certification which I can afford). Should I just work on my personal practice instead, or is this cold feet since the training begins in two months and I've never been this close to going through with it before ahaha. In case this is important, I'm in my early 20s. Are there other teacher's or teachers in training who can share more about why they chose to teach and if they felt any squeamishness before pursuing the training?

For context, I've had anterior pelvic tilt most of my life, but desk-based work has definitely exacerbated it. If I follow the cues my instructors give for ""neutral"" spine, such as ""align your ribs with your hipbones,"" it feels like I am more in an ""imprint"" position (i.e. posterior pelvic tilt).

I'm absolutely 100% ignorant about pilates and I'm scared of starting doing something too hard or inappropriate for my situation, so I'd like to ask if someone with more experience can help me.

I'm 27, female, and let's say that, for my age, my back isn't doing very well. I frequently have lower back pain which sometimes can become very annoying (for example after standing still for more than 5 minutes). I've done x-ray, been visited by a physiatrist and the response is that I've got slight scoliosis, discopathy and arthrosis and, if I don't do anything to get the situation better, I might regret it a lot when I become older. 

I've been recommended pilates to improve my situation and to start very gentle. 

I've never been flexible and always had difficulties perceiving and moving my body since I was a kid, and my posture also has never been the best...

I've done some exercises in the past and I always try to move on foot or by bycicle if I don't have to go far away, but my lifestyle is mostly sedentary (university student writing her thesis + part-time worker in office + drawing is my main hobby). 

As for weight and height, 65kgs and 174cm, so I'm average and I look normal, but my muscles are kinda weak.

I'm collecting informations about pilates courses in my town, but at the moment they're full and can't welcome new members, so I would like to do something on my own at home until I can join them, maybe watching videos on youtube, but I really can't understand how I should start, considered my situation!

1705325202.0,What's the vibe/community like at your studio? What kind do you prefer?,"I'm over in Norway, and the place I started reformer classes at is in a smaller city. At least half the women there are over 60, and people are generally friendly and cheerful. While I'm not 100% fluent in Norwegian, I'm conversational and don't have a problem following along in-class. We say hi and bye to one another, grimace in solidarity during the hardest moves, and occasionally have small conversations. 

When I was in Oslo over Christmas, I tried a different studio, and the vibe was totally different. Mainly young women, no one acknowledging anyone else, the instructor was an immigrant as well and did the class in English, but seemed bored, mostly looked at his phone, and barely offered corrections. Still a good workout, but much less enjoyable than my usual class.

I'm probably going to continue to try out new studios now and then - I want to try out different reformers to see which brand I like best.

1705294222.0,Classical vs. Contemporary explained,"I’ve noticed this is a common question in this community and with my clients. Here is the difference. 

Classical is the closest you can get to the way Joe Pilates taught. The equipment is different. The springs are different. For example, the springs on the reformer are all one resistance. 

There is a specific order for each exercise for specific reasons. There is a huge emphasis on transitions and flow. 

Pilates was originally designed to be the most effective and practical form of exercise for the average busy person. The apparatuses were developed after the mat work. (Example of apparatuses is Gratz equipment) 

Contemporary is everything that came after Joe Pilates. There are many many many different kinds of contemporary Pilates (some could argue they’re not even doing Pilates anymore). New exercises were made and classical exercises were changed. 

STOTT for example took a more physical therapy approach. BASI designed apparatuses that would fit bigger individuals and even created new equipment. 

The springs vary in contemporary, but for the most part there’s a full spring, half spring, and a quarter spring. This gives possibilities for new exercises. 

There is much less of an emphasis on transitions. 

Which one is better? 

That’s for you to try and decide.",pilates,2024-01-15 04:50:22

1705260461.0,What is this muscle and how can i help improve it,"hello, 

&#x200B;

I'm really struggling with an exercise and I'd like some advice on how to get better. 

The set up is: i'm facing the side and kneeling up (i.e. not kneeling down. My bum is not on my ankles, and my quads are perpendicular to the floor.).  Then I make my outer leg straight, and support myself with a straight arm on a pilates wheel that's on the floor.

From here, I need to lift my outer leg up. Most people in my class can do this so that its level with their hips, or higher. I can lift my foot about 2 inches off the floor and can only keep it there for a few seconds. 

&#x200B;

I know that part of my body is  not good (i was in a car crash when I was 17 that badly damaged all the muscles in both upper thighs. I'm now 36)  But I would really like to improve it. My instructor says its the gluteus medius and i can work on it by doing the above exercise with my elbow on the floor, rather than use an outstretched arm and a pilates wheel. However, I find this orders or magnitude easier so I'm sceptical. Perhaps I just need to do it a lot? Or perhaps there's a variation that's in the middle of those two options? 

All thoughts and advice appreciated.

This may be long, sorry!

But long story short - I worked  as a bather/apprentice for 1 year in 2019. I was 240lbs back then and in a lot of pain from my job. 
Since then, I’ve lost weight (and kept it off), and I am now at 160lbs. I’m still young, 26 years old, so I definitely want to keep healthy habits.  

I’ve been working in grooming again since August 2023. I absolutely love this job and I want to pursue it as a lifelong  career. However I have been in so much pain and I’ve hit a plateau on how to feel healthy and comfortable in my body, 

My lower back is so stiff, my shoulders are tight, my hips feel tight, wrists.. etc. and I stretch daily along with rotating between some mat yoga, barre, and Pilates at home from YouTube videos. 

My little home YouTube  routine has worked great for me up until I got back into dog grooming this past summer. I have been trying to work weekly on following routines that target flexibility, mobility and strength in my back, shoulders, hips, glutes, wrists, feet.. basically all the spots that are sore after a work shift. 

But my back feels tighter than ever and so do my shoulders and wrists. :( I don’t think these routines I follow are helping me feel young and healthy like I want. I can’t afford anything such as a gym or trainer so I’m relying on my YouTube instructors lol. 

I’m looking for advice from others who have been in the field for a while and have gotten their body to feel healthy and strong again.

1705144577.0,Pilates lifestyle and marketing in the USA - Asking for experience sharing,"Hello Pilates community 👋,

I would love to know from your experience how Pilates is actually marketed in the USA. Do studios offer extra services like merchandise shops or sell drinks ? Is there a local community? How do your clients discover Pilates? Who is the target audience? Is there a „Pilates lifestyle“?

The reason why I am asking is because I am from Germany and feel that Pilates has a marketing problem here. Which is a pity because this training method is so unique and beneficial. Except from big cities, Pilates is often offered in physiotherapy studios and is considered a therapeutic/preventative training. Since a health insurance is mandatory here, you can actually visit up to 20 mat classes per year almost for free and your insurance will reimburse the expenses. This is obviously great but this way Pilates still remains a niche fitness method. I also completed my mat instructor training and I was the only one in our cohort without the physiotherapeutic/sports science background. When attending classes in studios from my experience it is quiete transactional (finish the class and go home). And when it comes to the audience I mostly train with  people 40+. Don‘t get me wrong: The current situation is not bad per se and I am not complaining as I can be quite sure that the expertise of the instructors is decent. I also get the desired outcome after visiting a class. It‘s just the vibe is very efficient (typical for Germany) and straightforward. I have visited multiple studios across Germany and this was my overall feeling.

I just think that with this approach Pilates is not very accessible to the majority of younger people, it‘s not cool and often perceived as a problem zone training (bums-tums-legs or „Bauch-Beine-Po“ in German). 

That is why I would like to know whether you can tell about the perception of Pilates in the USA and its marketing. As it was covered in another post, Pilates is currently gaining popularity through social media and Pinterest is full of Pilates inspo. And I see some huge potential for Germany to go more into the  „fitnessy“ direction and to open up to the public.  

PS: I live in a city with 500K population which is considered decent for Germany.

I'm not from the US but I don't have many friends with pilates experience and so thought to seek your opinions and advice :)

I'm exploring pilates as a means to strengthen my core and hips/knees stability, so that I can do strength training safely and start the process of working out.

Due to some knee injuries I have, a few personal sessions will be necessary before I can do group classes. I've been looking around, and the cost of private sessions are 120 onwards. Is this usual?

One of the studios I was really interested in,  is the highest at $160 per session for 3 mths with an evaluation every month, and they'll go through a nutrition plan for you too. This includes a programme with strength training / flexibility / mobility,  and they will also offer suggestions on what exercises to do in the gym on other  days.

I really like this studio as the vibes are one of Rehab and ageing gracefully, with none of the fitspo kinda image, which is very in line with my aims. But I guess I'm double guessing if it's too expensive.

I haven’t practiced for the last 5 years, instead, I’ve been more of a Yoga asana flows person for the last almost 10 years and also meanwhile acquired Yoga Teacher Training.

I’m not going to exclusively compare them but I wanted to support my yoga practice with reformer pilates and bought a foldable reformer for myself at home.

When I went back to study the Pilates moves, it came off to me as too much focusing on abs, especially rectus abdominus and obliques. I have no desire to overly train them and get a boxy body. In yoga, core work is more subtle and it targets inner core muscles more (I could be mistaken since I’m not experienced in Pilates). 

Like, the most elemental “hundreds”, is it necessary? Don’t come at me for this, it’s simply my opinion but it feels like a glorified crunch exercise and furthermore it’s so easy to mess up if one does not know how to properly lift and engage the core and I feel like it could even lead to diastasis recti on regular people. I myself am 16 months postpartum and haven’t experienced a DR that would be an issue but I’m still reluctant to do any exercise that remotely resembles a crunch.

I got a foam roller for my upper back. It is a long one. I use it like on a photo but with dumbbells to work my arm and upper back muscles. I think it is helping with my right shoulder blade trigger point.

I see some pilates sessions on YouTube using a foam roller. Is there an advantage of using one during pilates?

1704912918.0,What are the WORST positions/moves for hip flexor issues?,"I've had a partial tear in both hip flexors, each about six months apart, in the last year and a half that kept me out of my sport for three-plus months at a time. I've been back to playing my sport 3-5 times weekly since September and haven't had any issues. Yet, I was surprised that my most recent side has flared up a tiny bit this past week... and the only thing I can tie it to is a few B the Method pilates sessions, which I'm now starting to suspect played a role in the previous two injuries.

Are there any positions/moves that are more taxing on hip flexors than others that I should maybe look to avoid or modify? Or things I may be doing in certain moves unknowingly that are likely to put strain on them? There are many exercises I did for PT that are also incredibly common in pilates (i.e. clamshells, glute bridges, etc.), so my only inkling is that it's related to tabletop and/or possibly use of the ball between the legs or under the glutes.

Thousands of dollars in PT has gotten me to the point where I’m 99% pain free for the last 2 years, though I do have some nerve damage on the right side of my right foot. If I move certain ways I sometimes feel a twinge in my back but it never progresses to pain. 

I am definitely out of shape but I can also do things some other people can’t, like touch my toes. I used to be able to touch my toes to my forehead also before the back injury. I can get close now but not quite. I also just did 26+ miles at Disneyland last month and tolerated it much better than my normal weight/more in shape husband!

I live in kind of a fitness club desert - there’s one huge LA Fitness that always has an overflowing parking lot, a bunch of CrossFit places, and recently one Club Pilates that opened less than 2 minutes from my house. Everything else is 25-30 minutes one way but with a full time job and other obligations I can’t spare 2 hours (commute + class) to go that far.

A. Has a more restricted movement of lumbar spine. This makes the back bend at the thoracic more accessible for those not able to use their core/have sufficient body awareness to control the movement of lower back.

B. Has less to focus on compared to keeping the top leg extended.

I have a monthly membership to a studio plus a discount on it--so I am kind of stuck in an affordability trap where if I leave/pause my studio membership I lose my big discount, but if I lower my membership tier I am only saving around $15 a month on a $300+ membership for way less classes because of how the pricing structure works. I was also locked into 3 months to start, and genuinely like the studio otherwise, most of all because so few studios in my ironically huge city do not offer classes at after-work hours that I can get to in time from where I live (WFH). I also like that they generally take it seriously when people show up very sick--if I am spending 4k a year on a membership for my health I want to be healthy.

My issue is that I was wiped out by covid 2 months into my 3 month requirement, and now not even 2 months later I have covid again (I am a chronic n95 mask wearer, I even double mask in class, I am covid vigilant in general)! My studio doesn't care about my plight in how dysfunctional this experience is (I get it, they are a business and other people will fill that spot if I am not there)--but at this point I have lost the better half of $1000 being sick from covid and its aftermath, between quarantining and getting back to good health. It almost feels like being in a pyramid scheme--even thought it may not be intentional, it certainly isn't responsive to this new reality--yet I also empathize with studio owners who need to stay in business (though to be fair, my studio is a lagree-style chain lol--btwn I was thinking of switching to a ""smaller"" studio with a class card, but again so few of them offer late enough classes and honestly many have more reformers than my current class--rents must be too high, so schools have way bigger classes in my city compared to pre-pandemic).

1704640848.0,Unlimited membership at Bodybar Pilates,"Pilates is my latest workout obsession!  Grateful for this sub!  I just joined in December, and am busy, learning all the equipment and learning about teeny muscles I never knew I had.  My workout journey began with a personal trainer, followed up by boutique gym memberships.  Now I’m at Bodybar, and am in love, I wonder what your workout journey is like, if you supplement Pilates with other workouts such as strength or cardio or HIIT.  I also wonder if Pilates has helped you become more “graceful”?  Here is my story: (TLDR at end)

I had a trainer/coach who really helped me get my mind right about exercise, for a couple years before I just couldn’t spare the expense any longer.  I started at OTF which didn’t cost as much, and would help me with accountability.  I loved Orange Theory for 5 years, until I didn’t love it anymore, and the pandemic happened, and did workout videos at home.  I dabbled in yoga, Pilates , strength, spin, workouts through streaming, and realized I hate all workouts in the beginning because I’m uncomfortable, learning something new.  But, if I keep it up, within a couple weeks, I begin to like it, and then even, love it.  I was doing well with streaming, but, missed the accountability a class provides.  

When a former OTF coach opened his own gym (copied the format of OTF but made it more strength training  based) I wanted to support his business, so I joined.  A year later, I was tired of hobbling around.  I only did 2 days a week, but would be so sore and achy painey, that I wouldn’t do much beyond walking/swimming on the other days.  I have arthritis, and wasn’t sure if it was arthritis or the workouts that had me hobbling around. It was sad for me to quit his gym, but I finally did, and began feeling a little better soon afterwards.   I have been walking or swimming until Bodybar opened, and it’s the most money I have ever spent on a gym, comparable to having a personal trainer a couple times a week.  This eats up all my workout budget.  I have been planning on Pilates 5 days a week, and walking/swimming in my community pool 2-3x a week to supplement.  My goal is to feel more comfortable in my own body, I want to glide more when I walk Instead of hobble or limp, and I need to keep my body in good condition, because I’m a hairstylist who doesn’t plan on retiring, ever!  (I love my job, former workaholic who stands in one area  all day long, it’s sooooo sedentary, even though I use all of my body, all day long. 

TLDR- former couch potato finds she likes boutique gyms and discovers Pilates, wonders what kind of exercises (if any) other Pilates lovers do other than Pilates to stay fit?

I've had instructors who say it is ok to be ""off cue"" (inhaling instead of exhaling, for ex.) as long as you are maintaining a connection to your breath.

She was talking about how important it is, as we get older, to also add in cardio and strength training, as pilates alone doesn't do much. 

Surely pilates counts as strength training...?

I've been going 3 times per week for 2ish months, and in that time I've noticed that I'm more flexible, my knees hurt far less, I'm stronger, and I just generally feel better than I used to. I usually choose difficult spring options to challenge myself, I choose heavier weight options, and I always finish having worked really hard (my legs are usually jelly and my arms feel the same).

How can I thoughtfully put together a month long plan for my pilates regimen? What do I need to consider?  I just finished Nicole Pearce's intro to pilates series on youtube doing a class a day. I loved it and could feel a difference immediately. I took one day off to rest and noticed my back pain returning!  It feels like the best thing I have done for my body in a long time.  But now that the series is done, I'm a little overwhelmed by all the options of her classes and the whole world of youtube pilates. I do plan on taking in person classes but money is limited at the moment and waiting for my workers comp to kick in.

I have a herniated disc between my L4 and L5, knee and hip issues as well. Nicole has a whole month long calendar with weights, HIIT, tabata and pilates. But it was when I did HIIT that I  first got injured. I can go zero to 80 and then I just reinjure myself.  I want to break that cycle and build slowly (although clearly I still went in with a class a day lol)  

Is it ok to just do mat pilates daily for a month and then see how I feel? I'm just not sure how to think about a pilates based routine/schedule. Does that mean I am neglecting other important ways for my body to move? I also plan on walking 30 min a day, building up to 60 min by the end of the month... plus my physical therapy. It's been going well so for and I'm trying to be super mindful of not pushing it (which it may not sound like from this post!)  I have struggled with this injury for years and felt quite defeated. Honestly this last week of pilates is the first time I feel a ray of hope that I don't have to live with such limited mobility and in such pain. What should I be thinking about? ie, varying up the parts of the body I work on each time so they have some rest or days apart?

My surgeons have long since cleared me to do core workouts, but I’m absolutely petrified. My background is in dance and my once-strong core is now pure mush. I think it might also be a mental fear of getting a hernia as well.

I don't want to make waves. People occasionally get hurt while exercising, and that's part of the deal. I'm not mad and I expect nothing in return. It will heal, and I will be fine. I also don't want it to seem like I'm accusing the instructor, since it likely could have just been my poor form.

\-- Does anyone know what he meant by this? 🤔 I mean, his description/photos show the legs close together at the start anyway, and then spread for the 'second movement' (if he means by this the descending part?).

The movement that gives me pain is all a variation of me lying on my back and moving my legs in circles. 

The right hip flexor hurts the most. It's not a sharp pain. It feels bony somehow? Hard to describe. Feels like something is getting snagged that shouldn't. 

How can I fix this? Is this something generic that will never be fixed with practice? It swims to get worse the more I do it, not better. I have started dreading working out, even when I modify this movement.

-How many studios are you working at to earn a livable wage ($60-70k?)
- How many hours do you work at each studio and across the board? 
-(Any details you feel comfortable sharing is much appreciated, like how much each studio pays for those hours)
-Do you do any online/virtual classes (what is the best method you have found that works best? YouTube, Patreon, TikTok etc)
-Do you own your own machine and just do private clients?
-Would investing in a few machines and running small classes from your home a viable idea?
-how much do you charge if you have gone that route?
-Are you responsible for for your own health insurance, etc

Thank you so much! 😊",pilates,2023-12-31 20:45:57

One thing I noticed is that I have a really hard time keeping my leg straight while laying on my back, I can only raise my leg about 60 degrees before I need to bend at the knee. The instructor and others in the class could keep their leg straight even with their legs over 90 degrees, I was really impressed and would like to work on my flexibility/ROM here. Any idea what could be holding me back here? Hamstrings, hip flexors? And how would I stretch or strengthen to improve?

The issue I’m running into is that I teach at the studio that is only reformer. I’d like to branch out and do my chair, Cadillac, and barrels course but I can’t practice those at my studio as we don’t have them. In addition- the city I live in doesn’t have tons of other studios that do other things outside of reformer and mat.

I feel a little lost, as I’d like a mentor and to deepen my knowledge so as of late I’ve been toying with the idea of doing another comprehensive training but potentially in the Classical realm. Is that insane? Should I just finish the comprehensive STOTT work ?

I know this question was asked before, but the post I saw was two years old…

——————————

I’m weighing my options for instructor training and I have narrowed it down to two options:

STOTTS
Intensive Program (Mat, Reformer, Chair etc) (comprehensive is not available in my area)

Or

Polestar 
Full Mat and Reformer Comprehensive program


I’m looking for a Contemporary program that is widely respected by the community. 

Are they very different from each other? Is one program more sought after by employers?

Polestar fits into my daily life much easier and is better spread out throughout the year, however I’ve read that STOTTS is highly respected and sought after… it would be tougher on my schedule (but doable) and it looks like there is room to take advanced courses after I finish the intensive program.

1703888208.0,How Much Does Rep of Teacher Training Matter For PT Work/Knowledge for Self Practice,"Hi Everyone, 

I am toying with the idea of going through teacher training. I've been wanting to teach in fitness for a while as a hobby (part time) but never felt really excited about a specific movement type to pull the trigger on a certification until I started doing pilates. Based on the advice on the other teacher training thread and my experience practicing, I think I've decided I want to be classically trained to start. 

The main options that aren't a complete inconvenience for me without a car/with a full time job are Equinox & a local gym. I've been doing pilates at the local gym and have thoroughly enjoyed my sessions way more compared to the Equinox ones I've done. According to one of the instructors bios, she was mentored under Romana, which I know means something. I've also had great experiences with the other instructors I've worked with. However, I don't know if the gym would be recognized if I ever moved out of the area or even didn't want to work for that gym specifically. It doesn't seem to be tied to a bigger classical school that I've seen posted on here. However, the local gym program is significantly cheaper than doing the Equinox program (like $5,000 in savings). Since I don't plan to teach full time and really want the knowledge to advance my own practice/to teach on a part time basis, does it make sense to do the more affordable, but less known training? 

Please let me know if there's other things I should consider in deciding this teacher training process. This is all relatively new to me. Thanks!",pilates,2023-12-29 22:16:48

However, the only studio in the area is Club Pilates, which from what I’ve read so far seems to be sub par. The other studios are small and locally owned, and do not provide any comprehensive or certified teacher training programs.

Should I go with the Club Pilates TT? The trainers at this studio seem experienced with the master trainer having 20 years experience and being certified in STOTT. 70% of the other instructors also seem to be certified through STOTT/BB/BASI and have 10+ years of experience.

1703811702.0,"Comprehensive Pilates Instructor Training - help determining ""true"" cost","Hi! I'm trying to pick between comprehensive pilates instructor training programs and there are a couple programs I am comparing. I know there have been past posts on this topic before but I'm hoping to get much more detailed and keep this post up as a resource.

I am having a hard time finding realistic cost estimates of how much people ended spending after you add in (often) required private pilates sessions, manuals, test fees, and other materials. I see a lot of mentions of people spending ""a few grand"" on privates / extra sessions; can anyone tell me if we're talking about $1-2k more or something closer to $5k more?

Here are the programs I looked at:

**Equinox pilates instructor training**

* Cost: \~$9.1k (total) \[Course - $7.3k / Privates - $1.8k / Time Cost: 10 months\]
* Bonus: Eligible to interview for teaching around 6 months in; flexible locations; Equinox membership included
* Downside appears to be lack of recognition by studios and apparently, according to 
* , an Ayn Rand feel

**Lifetime Fitness pilates instructor training (Stott)**

* Cost: $4.7k (half-cert)
* $2k for Intensive Mat-Plus (IMP) & $2.7k for Intensive Reformer (IR)
* Seems to only hit 220 total hours

**Balanced Body Comprehensive (Normal)**

* Cost: $7.7k \[Course - $6.6k (each course \~$600; need 11 courses = $6.6k) Sessions - $100 per month x 11 months ($1100) / Time Cost: 11 months\]
* I'm basing this cost estimate on Center of Balance in Mountain View, CA. Seems like you can do Pilates instructor training there in about 11 months. They offer a $100 / month program for instructors-in-training to get in their teaching, observation, and self-practice hours; privates are not included.
* This seems like a non-crazy training cost, though I was told by a current pilates instructor that she spent over $10k on her Balanced Body certification. Anyone with a BB certification able to confirm or deny? Is $6k for training realistic? She claimed that each module requires $300 of course materials and that there are hidden test-out fees? I only know of one test-out fee, so I don't know if she was trying to shill me or if hidden fees really are that bad.
* According to 
* : \~$10k total (though this included above-average travel to attend modules taught by different instructors)

**Balanced Body Comprehensive - Community College** (College of San Mateo or Fullerton College or West Valley)

* Cost: $800-1000 (resident) / \~$3.7k (non-resident) \[Time Cost: 1.5 years\]
* Community college offerings seem limited to the SF Bay Area, Greater Los Angeles, and Colorado; I saw a couple college programs for 4-year universities but they seem limited to dance majors (or wildly more expensive than community colleges)
* I haven't seen any reviews online about this program. It's unclear if the school would help you acquire observations and student teaching hours because those may occur off-campus, which probably is another $3k or so if that is needed. That said, the course sequence seems to indicate that just by taking their Instructor Training courses (KINE 125 / KINE 126 / KINE 127 for San Mateo), you would end up getting at least 450 hours worth of training via those classes alone; also, the pilates studio is free for students to use. It also seems like you are very dependent on when the specific classes are offered by the school, but seems reasonable to complete within 3 semesters.
* Seems really like a really great alternative to conventional Balanced Body training but the program description is a bit ambiguous. While I think the time required is a bit long, obviously the cost as a resident is really attractive even if you have to shell out for privates or other fees separately.

**Stott Pilates**

* Cost: $10.2k \[Course - $7860\]
* Based on a couple studios offering Stott training; not sure if cost is actually even higher\]

**Power Pilates**

* Cost: $6.9k+ \[Core Mat I & II (pre-reqs) - $1.4k / Comprehensive course - $5.5k\]
* Unclear what other additional fees are needed
* According to 
* [**Fit-Combination-2538**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fit-Combination-2538/)**:** total cost is \~$8.5k after adding on the required 25 or so privates; one advantage of the program is having a relatively longer time frame for completion (18 months)

**BASI**

* Cost: $5k+ \[Course - $4.5k + Unknown studio / practice fees (arranged by studios)\]
* Not a lot of indication of studio time cost (my reference was Encore Pilates Center in San Jose); seems like the best physical hub is Chicago
* According to 
* : total cost was almost exactly $6.5k after test-outs and add-on fees; caveat is that this may depend on local studio because this number was the result of a studio owner who let students use space free of charge and paid out for student teaching hours

**Polestar**

* Total Cost: $9.2k
* Based on a rogue webpage on Polestar from 2020 regarding a training hosted in Chicago.Unclear if additional sessions or materials are needed.
* According to 
* : training fees were not included in the course fee and additional fees included $180 worth of manuals, a separate anatomy course you had to seek out yourself, and $600 for test-out (circa 2017)
* According to 
* : paid $7.2k worth of course fees and about $150 worth in manuals. Additional costs included travel, privates, and liability insurance (\~150 / yr)
* Update: Quote from Polestar team was $6.9k, which doesn't seem to include studio training cost (I saw a host studio charging $250 per month to facilitate observation and student teaching hours); so assuming a 9 month process, total cost is $9.2k
* According to 
* : paid $8k in total, and course fees included the anatomy course and the sessions were comprehensive enough to skip the need for additional privates

**Real Pilates**

* Cost: $9.8k \[Tuition to Real Pilates - $5.8k /Training Center (mandatory training package) - $3k to $6k / Time Cost: 8 months\]
* I looked at the costs of a couple different host studios for the Real Pilates training (Somaspace in TX, Grace in Louisiana, Chesapeake in Maryland). The main Real Pilates location charges $4200 for their add-on training package.

**Peak Pilates**

* Cost: $6.3k+ (needs input) \[Course - 8 courses x $700 + 2 test-outs x $350 = $6300\]
* Unclear if additional payment for studio hours is needed; I assume so
* According to 
* : the series can be completed by module and just Level 1 should be enough to start teaching (roughly $2.8k before privates). Level 2 is about $1.8k before privates. Biggest variable is studio observation and privates cost.

**Club Pilates**

* Cost: $5k (needs input) \[Time Cost: 1 year\]
* Plus: Eligible for apprentice teaching midway through program
* Unclear to me how much in additional cost studio / class / privates may add; I assume you could just buy a membership at around $200 a month. So assuming a year-long process, then maybe $7.4k in total. Anyone having done CP before able to add detail?



Given how expensive all the trainings are, I wonder if I ought to try to get Lagree certified instead. My biggest concern is locking myself into a program and then discovering afterwards that there are loads of additional material, sessions, privates, and test-out fees too late. **Thank you in advance to anyone who contributes!!**

I plan to audition to become an instructor and see the ins and outs of what it truly is to run or teach at a studio.  


I've had an idea of opening up a studio in my hometown since there are very few pilates studios, much less with actual reformers, mostly only mat. The fitness culture back home is also very big, but I am currently in the process of doing a little more extensive market research.  


As to opening up a studio, I've looked up equipment costs, retail space rent costs, the aesthetic of it, renovation costs, training costs, etc.  


Only catch is: I have no money. I work a simple 9-5 and make an average amount annually. I've considered getting a small business loan but my credit score is not great so I've made a plan to work on it this year in hopes of getting it high enough to apply for a loan.  


I'd love to hear from boutique studio owners. How did you start your studio? did you have savings? did you get a loan out? did you teach it all yourself? did you get staff and pay them? How did you afford that?

I have a few questions and I’d be grateful for any advice, please.

#Aims:
- Improve posture & strengthen core etc
- Go on a comprehensive mat & equipment teacher training course for my own sake (to develop my knowledge/practice)

#Background:
- Pilates beginner
- desk job postural problems that I want to improve (cervical & sacral discs pinching on nerves, stiff thoracic spine, weak core & back muscles + tight chest, hamstrings and hips, tension carried in neck and shoulders, & forward head but not severe)
- I had physio, was the. recommended clinical Pilates with a physio but it’s far too expensive so I’m looking to do regular Pilates
- I have gone to 10 reformer classes with different studios - EVERY instructor has a different style so I don’t know what type of teaching style is best for my aims
- I tried 1 mat Pilates class and found it very difficult (tough on my wrists, didn’t feel strong enough and sequences were fast) 

#General Pilates questions:
1. Should I be looking for classical or contemporary teaching styles & what differences are there beyond a fixed sequence?
2. Is mat or reformer better for my needs?
3. Following on from Q1. which teacher training course method is best for my aims? Can anyone recommend one in London?
4. Has anyone with back / postural issues also done strength training (eg for strengthening the back) alongside Pilates?
5. Does Pilates help with tight hips & hamstrings too?
6. Are there any UK/London based Pilates groups like on FB or discord?

#East London (E1) / Central London studios:
Has anyone tried the following studios & can offer feedback or recommend a teacher?
- Broadway Pilates
- YMCA KX (they also teach Stott Pilates)

I tried Broadway Pilates and YMCA KX. I tried two different teachers at each studio. At both, there was one teacher that seemed more foundation/postural focused and the other was more fitness-y.

I can’t make the YMCA classes as ALL of the beginner classes are early & scheduled first before int/adv (teachers, please don’t do this & give us beginners the later time-slots on occasion!) and I can’t get there after work in time. But I did notice they offer Stott Pilates teaching course. Is that worth a try?

1703608037.0,Rude pilates instructor? or I’m thinking way too much,"I had a weird interaction with a Pilates instructor today and I am just wondering if I’m just taking it too hard.

I’ve just started getting back into Pilates reformer and I am not an athletic person whatsoever. I’ve been to going to one particular Pilates studio for a while now (since there’s not much choice of Pilates studio from where I am from) and I’ve been trying my hardest to do all  the forms that were taught in class (some I can do easily and some I struggle).

I signed up for a class with a new instructor whom I never have much interaction with before and as I was struggling to do certain poses/forms on the reformer, she would come to me and asked me “do you need an ambulance?” In a joking manner (which I don’t mind). She occasionally corrected me but for one of the poses, she slapped my leg as I didn’t know that I have to relax my leg for that pose.

As the class progressed, I couldn’t do one of the forms as she’d told and she asked me “Have you taken my class before?” I respond and say “No”. And she told me “Don’t come back again”.

She occasionally corrected me and her techniques are easy to understand (which is exactly what I was looking for). I just felt disheartened by her reactions and comments. I don’t know. Maybe I was the weakest person in the class? It just felt like she wasn’t encouraging and kind about it. She didn’t give the same energy to the other woman in the class.

I don’t know. I’ve taken many classes with other instructors and I’ve never felt so disheartened. PS. There is no level system (different classes for beginner or intermediate) at the Pilates studio that I went to. It just sucks and I felt bad really bad about myself.",pilates,2023-12-26 16:27:17

1703543270.0,Transitioning from beginner to intermediate level?,"Hey everyone - I'm in my early 20s (don't want to state my exact age) and I started doing pilates at home almost two months ago now. I've been really enjoying it - I can already feel my body getting stronger, and it improves my mood as well. So far, I've been watching Move with Nicole - I found her channel through this subreddit, and I like her teaching style. I started with doing workouts twice a week, then I increased it gradually to the point where I'm now doing it 5-6 times a week. This wasn't part of my goals, I just enjoyed pilates a lot and wanted to do more of it whenever I felt able to and had time. I've only used videos from the beginner level playlist, I've gone through it a few times now. They've definitely become much easier for me - the only things I still struggle with somewhat are the abs exercises where you touch your toes to the ground from a tabletop position, and anything involving propping myself up on my arms (cause my arms are weak haha). But even those have seen a lot of improvement. I've tried a couple videos from her moderate level playlist, but I found them to be quite a jump in difficulty and pace. I'm wondering if anyone has recommendations for easing myself into them. Perhaps specific videos, or adjustments I can make to exercises to make them more challenging, stuff like that. Thank you :)  


Also, a note on my history with working out if that would help. I did ballet about ages 5-11, then fencing ages 13-17, and then I stopped working out completely, so I've lost a lot of the strength I used to have. My legs especially used to be super strong, I'm kinda bummed about losing that aha. My cardio and endurance was never particularly good, but I do walk quite a lot nowadays. I also did pilates for like half a year during quarantine, but my instructor then didn't explain much about proper form so I did a lot of exercises wrong.  


Anyways, that's all. Thank you :)",pilates,2023-12-25 22:27:50

It’s been 15 years since my fusion, so I’m very healed and also quite physically active. I usually run or do standard strength training with dumbbells.

See the differences, etc. I know... probably a slight waste of money, but so many people speak so highly of BB and the trainer for Peak who trained me used to be a BB trainer.



So anyway, I signed up for Reformer 1 and there wasn't anywhere (not that I noticed) on that page stating you had to do a Movement Principles pre-req. But after signing up, I was looking at their other trainings and on some other page they mention that is a pre-req for their mat and reformer trainings... so I replied back to my order confirmation email (not even thirty minutes after placing the ""order"" for the training) asking to cancel since I have not done that pre-req. I actually expected them to charge me the $100 cancellation fee... but in the email I got back, they said no problem, thanks for being so quick to let us know, we'll cancel it and fully refund you



That was back on the 6th.



On the 11th, I got an email providing me login info for their education portal. I emailed the customer service agent who'd originally responded. I figured the cancellation was still in progress, but wanted them to know so they could revoke my access - since if my order was being canceled, I had not paid for that material.



On the 12th, I got a notice that my order from BB was being shipped - likely the books / manual. I email the info @ email address and tell them...

1702996906.0,Rest day from Pilates questions,"Hi all! 
So I’m confused on what a rest day truly is. I do Pilates 7 days a week and walk 5-7 miles a day. I’ve been told rest days are essential but I can’t bring myself to take one without feeling lazy. I don’t think I’ve taken a rest day in like 3+ months. 
I’m finally going to force myself to take one because my muscles have been sore and I’m dealing with some residual water retention from that. 
My question is: is it still considered a rest day if I only cut out Pilates for the day and continue on my regular walking schedule? Or possibly walking a little more? Or can/should I incorporate some minimal floor exercises?

I asked them to postpone as long as possible when I ordered over The Black Friday sale.

I even called to see if I could delay a few more weeks and they will not (which I understand but was hopeful), so I have been trying to move furniture, etc.

I have stairs off the living room.

So, one stair to a landing, sharp turn right to go up the stairs and then sharp left into the room.

I was told they usually unbox before they bring it in, but depends on the weather basically.

Can either of you describe how it came and was it easy for the freight staff to get up stairs?

Was it a piece of cake for them or is it so long, heavy and cumbersome that they struggle?

For any private teachers how do you structure your class? Ie: flow, pace etc. Also how do you continue your learning after you graduate? When I watch you tube reformer teachers they have so many good cues and suggestion on engagement etc. Or when I attend a good class I always wonder where they learned things because it wasn’t taught that way to me in my training.

* arm fat specifically armpit fat and when my arms fold down, they don’t have a clear fat so eg if i want to wear a spaghetti strap dress
* face fat, specifically the cheek area so its not too chubby or wide even
* not sure if possible but i have broad shoulders(?) or like a wider torso that the bottom half of my body, any tips on how to minimise that? 
* back fat eg when sitting down and neck folds when looking up from the back, but i feel like this has more to do with posture rather than exercise? 
* and lastly, belly fat, specifically the lower half of my belly, the pouch? it’s strangely larger than the rest of my stomach, my stomach is kinda shaped like a C ? at the top its chubby then it arches inwards and then becomes chubby again at the lower part. i also want to achieve like a slight hourglass body too, not something too grand but something noticeable. 

and yeah, not sure if those above are even possible with pilates but any advice please do let me know, generally i would like to loose overall body fat/ mass/ weight? also not sure if this is possible but i’m not too fond of my bum, its big, and i don’t really like it, as my chest is a bit on the smaller side and it just makes me look weird if that makes sense? but anyways thanks in advance everyone and sorry if wrong thread/ community 😓

I've found financial models in google but these are paid and we're not allowed to possess nor spend hard currency in my country unless we have an authorization, which we only would acquire if we already planned the business.

I basically need 3 statement financial models which I can then tweak according to our financial capacities and the overall economic state of our country. I know these info may be hard for people to share, but I assure you I'm very very far of you and you can always maintain your model's privacy by changing names or something.

Edit: I'm not asking for someone to build the financial statements. I only need existing ones which I would later tweak.

Thank you very much and sorry for any mistakes, English is my fourth language.",pilates,2023-12-12 09:57:19
1702372907.0,Equipment for upper back mostly for home pilates,"Hi, my posture is not great at all. No problem with the back (checked with x-ray), but just hunched. I think it's because I have large breasts and they are heavy and I always hated them :D I also get a pain under my right shoulder blade when I walk. 

I started doing pilates in class and with videos (Nicole) in the evening and would like to progress faster. I thought some equipment could help. I have my eyes on the magic circle and maybe some weights. 

Are there other pieces that could help me? I see the foam roller being recommended frequently, but I am not sure what it is for.

(for home practice to supplement studio classes),"I've been going to reformer classes for about a year (about 2x/week on average), and just got a Metro IQ.

Looking at the sequences, I think a couple of the teachers I take classes with structure their classes closer to the classical sequences than others. I'm not planning to do anything I haven't done in class -- I think I've done at least part of all the series on the beginner and intermediate lists -- but I'd love to hear opinions on the best way to build up a home practice and memorize the series.

1702255071.0,Question: Reformer/Tower and lower back pain,"Hi!

I started pilates in April of this year and I really have loved it (reformer). I was a total newbie to the space, but really wanted to work on my core strength. I had an L5 S1 microdiscectomy surgery in 2016 that was successful. My pilates instructor is a physical therapist as well, so she has helped me with modified positioning. First couple classes I was sore, but I have had little to no problems since. I am very active and live in an outdoor community where I hike 10+ miles in the summer + fall regularly.

However, I had my first **reformer/tower** class combo Dec 1, as well as a particularly very active week in life. I can't really tell ultimately what did it, but I'm having my first back flare up in a few years which is extremely disheartening. My dad is a surgeon so I already have the medical advice aspect (how to calm it down and rest), but I'm wondering what possibly could have been so different with the tower vs. typical reformer class to put me over the edge. I still am not really up to pilates terminology--one thing I'm thinking are those small circles with my legs that activate more of the SI area?

Also wondering if there was any advice to avoid this in the future. I contacted my instructor about this too, but right now, I'm honestly scared to go back (and I recently just purchased a 30-pack class membership).

For more context, I work from home, don't have the best posture, and had been out-of-character sedentary for a few months (went through thyroid cancer, took walks but no strength training). Got back to the gym/pilates second week of November. Just looking to really take care of my body/posture moving forward. Any recommendations would help!",pilates,2023-12-11 00:37:51

I have weak arches, so I always assumed my feet were pronated. However, in a group class last week, the instructor told me to avoid focusing pressure on the outer edge of my feet during footwork. When I got home and checked some of my shoes, a lot of the soles were worn out on the outer edge instead of the inner edge, and it all made sense. These few days I’ve noticed that I do tend to walk with the outer edge of my feet, even when barefoot on the carpet.

I have private sessions scheduled weekly, but my instructor is not fluent in English so I was hoping to read more about it before bringing it up. Interestingly, she has never mentioned this issue during our sessions. She is classically trained, while my group instructor is BASI trained; I wonder if that could be why?

1701882964.0,Throwing myself to the wolves,"Recently someone asked what the point of this sub was. Others have asked is it necessary to be certified to teach Pilates. Someone else asked about the breakdown of the training program. 
This post is not to call anyone out but to answer all of those questions in one post. I’m a teacher by profession and have learned if one person has a question, most likely, others have the same or similar. 

I realize I may be opening myself up to hateful comments or even someone wanting to argue with me (which is why I rarely post or comment). To those, I’ll say, this is my experience and these are my opinions. We need to learn to be a little kinder to each other in this sub while still getting good information out there. 

I believe the confusion comes from the lack of any type of regulation in the Pilates community. It’s a complete free-for-all-shitshow out there. And, if you’ve spent enough time in the community, you know what I mean and I feel your frustration. I wish there was something we could do about it but with TikTok and YouTube and large chains teaching their version of Pilates, let’s face it, we’re facing an uphill battle of epic proportions. 

Now, to answer a few questions 🙂

Regarding certification hours vs “real life hours”. I get the confusion here but try to think of these hours in a similar fashion as college credit hours. Yes, my certification took 600 hours and almost 1.5 years to complete. Unfortunately, you can’t just attend a 40 hour per week course, practice teaching, observe, etc in a few months time. I’ll give you an example of the breakdown of my hours below. These are not perfect as I don’t remember the exact number but they’re pretty close. 

*In person classes/learning each piece of apparatus and every exercise. These took place March thru October (one weekend per month; Friday -Sunday 8a-5p exhausting!) Best shape of my life, though!

*Practice teaching on other apprentices

*Anatomy

*Written tests

*Test outs

*Observation hours

*Homework

*Individual practice at the studio (free to use all equipment by ourselves when studio was empty)

All hours had to be logged and signed off by our teacher trainer. I don’t remember the breakdown but I do remember the categories. Some of these were self paced which is why it may take one person longer than another to complete. However, no one could complete the course and be certified until their final 600 hour test out which you couldn’t do until after the final in-person class. 

Our in-person sessions were broken down similar to this:

*Mat
*Beginner system 
*Intermediate system 
*Advanced system 
*Props and modifications 
*Special populations 

As you can see, this was fairly intense and required a lot of physical, emotional and mental work. Not to mention the financial investment. We also are required to take continuing education classes every year to maintain our certificate. 

This may help others understand why we, as instructors, take our certification seriously, and get unsettled when we hear of someone just running out and buying a reformer to use at home with basically no training from an instructor. Or when some influencer who just wants followers and profits uses the word “Pilates” to take advantage of people. Believe it or not, there is so much that goes into Pilates and the very basics are of the utmost importance. 

I’d like to add one more thing; if you’re paying for Pilates from a certified instructor and all you’re doing is the reformer, you are doing yourself a huge disservice. Pilates is a system of exercises designed to build upon each other. I was taught, no less than three pieces of equipment (mat counts as a piece) per class. Can you imagine how much more exciting your classes would be if you used the tower, chair, ladder barrel, mat or reformer during every class?  Maybe even the guillotine…what?! The way your body might respond to these challenges and different pieces of equipment?  The pride you’d leave with knowing you accomplished something new and unique. Also, please insist your instructors teach short spine!  There is nothing dangerous about it unless the instructor doesn’t know how to teach it properly. It’s one of the most popular and amazing exercises! At least, try it! And, you have every right to ask about your instructors certification (and you should). We take zero offense to this!  

Be kind. We’re all fighting together for a better world. In the end, it’s Pilates and as much as I love it and devote my energy, time and most of my life to it, it’s Pilates. Peace 🫶🏻",pilates,2023-12-06 17:16:04

1701805417.0,Back extension option,"I sometimes struggle with adding back extensions into my routines due to a limited number of options available in the “classic/contemporary” programming. Don’t get me wrong there are some amazing options for extensions but, with time, this can become samey. Not to mention there is only so many springs you can add to the long box for the airplane/plough before it becomes impractical.

This version is far from the original Pilates option, but is almost a reverse up stretch. What makes the progression unique however is that it introduces another back extension option and leaves you with many ways to build your program. You can go into the mermaid series or the tree, or progress from those into this. You can add some skating before or after. Either way it’s a novel way to look at what is possible on the reformer. 

Notice that the footbar is not quite all the way down. This allows for some foot stability to prevent the legs from sliding.

1701646200.0,Balanced Body vs Power Pilates for teacher training,"Hi all!

I love pilates and finally decided to pursue teacher training! I've done a lot of research (on this sub, online, and asking instructors) and narrowed my search to two programs: Power Pilates and Balanced Body.

I started my practice at Club Pilates years ago and my instructor at the time was certified through Balanced Body. She was incredible and had years of knowledge under her belt. When I called her to ask her about her experience with BB, she loved how it had a bigger focus on Physical Therapy and Anatomy/Movement. I've since then moved on from Club Pilates and practice at a local studio with instructors from BB that say the same thing.

However, I have taken a bunch of Power Pilates classes (\~10) when I was visiting NYC earlier this year and had a fantastic time at the HQ! I felt like the class was much more challenging and a bit different (since it's classical vs contemporary). After searching this sub, it seems like Power Pilates is the closest to what Joseph Pilates originally intended, and the teaching program focuses heavily on HOW you teach vs WHAT you teach.

Both BB and Power Pilates studios are nearby and fit my schedule, so it's not a matter of access for me.

My eventual goal is to first get Mat Certified, then Reformer Certified, and eventually a Comprehensive Certification. In terms of career goals, my dream is to open up my own studio in my home country to help strengthen and rehabilitate the local skiiers/snowboarders, snow workers, and general population.

Does anyone have experience or recommend one over the other?

edit: I've only encountered instructors from BB or Power Pilates, which is why I didn't include BASI, Polestar, etc.

tl;dr: My impression is that Balanced Body education focuses more on Anatomy and Movement, and Power Pilates focuses more on Teaching effectively. I tried both types of classes and would like to know what people recommend.",pilates,2023-12-03 23:30:00

in summary, we all care about how we look and we try to look better whenever we can. what I'm curious about is that both on the Internet and in the social environment, when this good look is over the body, people face with a more negative reaction.

1701463614.0,Body Bar Pilates Experience,"I have been a member at the BODYBAR Pilates in chicago for a few months. I will say the classes are great and the equipment is easy to use; especially since the instructors break down how to use the equipment. Everyone is super nice as well! From the front desk personnel, to instructors even individuals taking the class. 

However, there is a CON! 

Do not do their monthly memberships with set classes as their policy is if you don’t use them, you LOSE them. They have membership packages of 4 classes, 8 classes, an unlimited course package and a few other ones that I cannot recall at the moment. However, you can pay for courses individually each time you sign up to take a course. 

The second negative about body bar is that when you go to cancel the membership you either have to do it in person or you have to email them. And you also have to cancel it 30 days before your next billing cycle Otherwise, you will need to purchase it again before your membership officially cancels. And there is no reimbursement once payment is submitted; or so I have been informed. 

Not very consumer friendly. 

When you sign up for BODYBAR classes they have no trouble charging IMMEDIATELY, but in order to cancel you have to jump through all these hoops. It took me about 10 min to locate the email to reach out to as the email I was provided over the phone was incorrect wickerpark@bodybarpilates.com. On their website I could not locate anything about cancellation of memberships, but only to freeze it. I have attached photographs for proof. I was able to track down a terms and service page, which was not easy to find on their website and located an email of legal@bodybarpilates.com which finally worked to send out, but only time will tell if they actually cancel it. I felt that BODYBAR purposefully made it inconvenient for me and anyone else to cancel in hopes that you won’t cancel or forget to do so.

I currently try to weight lift at least 3 days a week, tho sometimes I don’t hit all 3 days. My university is about to have 6 weeks off for our winter break, and if my funds allow it, I’d like to try out some reformer Pilates classes alongside my weight lifting workouts. I want to see if I’ll enjoy the classes and get a better understanding of proper breathing and form so that way when the Spring semester starts, I can cut down to once a week group classes. My goal is to start at a small, local Pilates studio and maybe move to club Pilates once I start the once a week classes if it is cheaper than continuing at the local studio. 

My question is, obviously my weight is going to impact my performance when doing Pilates. Should I wait until I lose more weight (I started at a higher weight then what I was at now a few months ago) to start Pilates? Or should I contact the instructor/owner of the local studio and see what their policies are on plus size people doing Pilates?

Does anyone have any experience being plus size and doing Pilates? What were your guys results and journeys like? Do you go local or use a club Pilates? If you are plus size and started at club Pilates, what was it like?

I also wanted to mention that I’ve tried mat Pilates from YouTube videos and I like them but I have trouble keeping myself consistent with them.

1701279724.0,Conversation re: hesitancy or refusal to talk about weight in regards to Pilates benefits,"I see many comments pushing back on the benefit or even going as far as stating pilates has little or nothing to do with weight loss.

Hear me out,

As a medical professional, weight concerns are very valid.  I personally feel that if someone is hopeful that one of the **many benefits** of pilates will also be weight loss, there is nothing wrong with that hope or goal.  They too may incorporate less calories, maybe chose a plant based diet.  They also may hope to see pilates as one of the tools to address excess weight.

Excess weight, lands in the liver, squeezes the heart so it cannot function as well, squeezes the lungs, contributes to vascular issues, among many other health concerns.  Excess weight can contribute to early death.

So, I think it is important to separate the society harm that has been caused by body image issues and focus to the health issues, when people are asking if Pilates will benefit weight loss.

I totally get the harm with body image discussions, but I do not think people are always just focused on that. I give people credit, that they are wanting to lose some extra weight for health reasons and are hoping that it is one of the many benefits from pilates.

I see no benefit, in every time someone asks about weight loss, people go on a tangent about how pilates has all these other benefits and basically say, drop the weight conversation.

There are more productive ways to communicate support, than dismissing peoples questions or concerns about a very serious health issue, as in excess weight,

1701219511.0,Pilates Instructor Moving from Brazil to the United States,"Hello all,

My fiancée is a newly minted Pilates instructor based in the Rio de Janeiro area, certified through a program that allows her to teach within Brazil, but not internationally. Her certification required 48 hours of in-person classroom instruction and 76 hours of internship, and covered classical Pilates (to include equipment and mat). From what we can tell, her education is something along the lines of an abbreviated comprehensive course. We are anticipating a wait of approximately one year before she will be able to move to the US, during which she will be teaching clients at a local studio in Brazil and accruing hours teaching classes. Once she is stateside, there will probably be another six-month period of waiting before she will be able to work. Her goal is to have similar focuses working here as she does now in Brazil, and to acquire any certifications required during the waiting period to start work.

We are trying to figure out what the best path is for her to become an instructor here in the US and whether or not her experience teaching in Brazil will count towards her education and/or professional development. She is very much a hands-on learner, trying to avoid online certification in lieu of in-person education, but also trying to avoid redundancies where possible due to the nature of recertifying and potentially re-interning. 

With that, some specific questions we have come up with are as follows, although we are open to any and all information that may be helpful:

Is certification generally acquired locally, nationally, internationally, or some combination thereof? Some quick research suggests Pilates is unregulated federally, but studios still require industry courses and certs.

Are there specific governing organizations or agencies that are considered industry standard in the US? So far, it looks like PMA is a recurring name, but is this the only one, or are there others?

Does education generally cover the full spectrum of Pilates instruction in a ""one and done"" certification (a bit of browsing suggests this might be comprehensive certification), or is there expected to be an acquisition of subspecialties acquired individually after general education is completed if you want to teach to those points? I.e. Can she teach both mat and reformer after completing one course, or does she need a general course and follow-on courses for the mat and reformer qualifications?

If intern/work hours are required to become certified, will she be able to count her hours over the next year in Brazil towards industry certification?

What is a good long-term budget to save for her education from start to finish? Generally, it seems like $5500-$7000 is roughly what can be expected if none of her experience transfers and she is required to start over from scratch.

Overall, it looks like something like the Power Pilates Bridge program might be an appropriate option by the time she gets here, as opposed to a full Power Pilates Comprehensive program, but hopefully someone here will better be able to speak to that.

Forgive me if anything I ask doesn't quite make sense. She is better versed in the world of Pilates, while I am more familiar with the US mindset of governing agencies and professional development (and reddit), so you are witnessing the byproduct of a team effort here. She will be reading your responses right along with me, so anything you think may be relevant to the journey is welcome, especially if it answers a question that is either poorly structured or remains yet unasked.

1701140501.0,Reputable training vs Comprehensive Cert,"I have been taking pilates for 5+ years and recently made the switch to teaching. I was “trained” at a smaller studio where I started teaching but the training was pretty minimal/basic. Recently I moved to a more competitive Pilates market and am looking for new teaching gigs, none so far that I have applied to/interviewed with have required certifications given that I already have experience teaching. I know I am a skilled instructor (based on client feeedback and reviews) but part of me wants to get more formal training to make me an even better instructor on paper. 

My questions is for other Pilates teachers, what are your thoughts on doing just a BASI Mat&refomer training vs. BASI
Comprehensive given my back ground? Also for context I work full time and Pilates is a passionate part time job for me. I don’t plan to make the switch the full time or running my own business yet because I also love my day job. 

Comprehensive feels like a bit of overkill because I plan to stay in the contemporary Pilates space on just a reformer so no Cadillac no chair etc. also comprehensive is super expensive compared to the mat&reformer training and if I can get a job without it I’m having a hard time justifying unless there is a HUGE difference in how I will be perceived as an instructor. Do you feel like comprehensive is the only way to go to legitimize yourself as an instructor?

When teaching, I am pretty physically close to the client, spotting them and sometimes touching them.

This morning I woke up with the symptoms of a start of a cold: postnasal drip, dry sinus, dry and scratchy throat. I am not coughing constantly (yet), but I do have dried out bloody and bright green mucus from the sinus, which means there is an active infection my body is fighting. My voice is clearly scratchy. If I cough, which I will at least once during a session with a client, I have a bit of phlegm. I have mild body aches.

I am relatively new to this job and I haven't called in sick yet. I have sessions today, tomorrow, and every day of this week. I am planning on cancelling the whole week because I am at least full-blown sick for a week when I catch something. I am just now thinking of how I will handle stuff like this in the future. Me and this other instructor are the only two instructors at my studio, and she already has a full schedule. Nobody can sub for me. My new manager doesn't know yet that I have a tendency to get sick often.

I get sick pretty frequently, like once every three months or even once a month as of lately. It could be a poor immune system, or it could be something else. My blood panel comes out fine, the doctor never finds anything wrong with me. All that ""eat well, sleep adequately"", wash your hands, wear a mask, exercise, none of that matters. I get sick like clockwork.

Every guideline I see online says don't go to work if you have a fever, but it doesn't talk about any other symptoms. There's so many anecdotes of people just popping dayquil and coming into work. I can pop a dayquil and suppress my cold symptoms, but possibly overwork myself and also possibly infect others (you're still infectious even without symptoms). Especially because unlike other jobs, I am physically close to my clients so the chance of infection is higher.",pilates,2023-11-26 14:30:25

1700925103.0,Help me be patient with my master instructor ( should I stay or should I go?),"I don’t want to hate pilates, but I’m starting to. I’ve been practicing pilates since 2021 I decided to start my journey in become a pilates teacher 2022 and this year I decided to pursue my comprehensive classical pilates teaching training. Pilates isn’t my main thing, I don’t do it for a career just strong interest I just want to be healthy, I have a 9 hour job, i got a full reformer and i paid by money, sweat and blood to be in this teacher training.

My issue and maybe this is just a rant to “exhale” if you will idk, is my master instructor. She’s angry and have unpredictable behavior. Her emotions in one training day fluctuates maybe 5 to 6 times and she makes sure to explode them at you. When she’s sweet, she lifts you up, when she’s angry, she tear you down. She shouts ( yes her voice and tone becomes unprofessional).

I honestly don’t love this dynamic. She’s not my mom, for me to have a tip toe around her emotions and please dynamic where i need therapy after, I truly just want to learn. I’ve been patient with her approach at first cause I thought she’s only like that because she wants to produce perfect teachers. But my belief system quickly was refuted when I taught a full session with other teachers teaching a full session in the same room in our workshop while she observes and she gave everyone elaborate feedback based on things she noticed they’re doing wrong and she gave me very concise feedback that doesn’t add any value to me (she said that I was a disaster mentioned excerise that I got the order for wrong but I couldn’t have because I didn’t even teach those) and that’s it gave no feedback on my teaching. She could have noticed more, she could have told me something about my teaching i am not aware of like the others (btw, i am not saying she singled me out intentionally- but this is one small example of her unpredictability) 

She listened to people’s ques, some people were chating while teaching and made jokes and gave them feedback but I was just a disaster because you didn’t remember the exact order-fine. 

I feel great disappointment because i was putting up with all the yelling and shouting, sudden change one tone and I just expected better and I’m starting to fall out of love from all of this. Like I want to feel good, this is why I do this extra hobby. If i want to feel shitty about myself I would go back to my actual life stresses that I am doing Pilates to escape. And now i’m considering dropping out of the program.

I have the Revo spring bar on my new studio reformer with Infinity footbar and am wondering about proper positioning of both bars. 

For the Revo spring bar, the BB website says: “For short to average height clients, use positions #1 or #2. For taller clients, or those with a limited range of motion, use positions #3 - #5.”  But I can’t find anything that says whether 1 is closest or furthest from the footbar. I’m 5’10” so maybe I should be in #3?

On a recent online class I was doing the instructor recommended for a particular exercise to put the spring bar in position one. I assume that’s the same one mine is already in. That made me realize if it should “normally” be in a different position.

I have the same question about the Infinity footbar position. I was putting it all the way to the end, thinking that was good for tall people (though I guess I’m not *that* tall). Then I realized I had to move it towards the risers quite a bit in order to install the jumpboard, which made me think the “normal” setting for it would be that exact spot. 

Any tips or resources would be greatly appreciated. I have my next in studio private session in a couple weeks and could ask then, but was hoping to learn about it as soon as possible in case I’m doing it wrong.

I would love to know what constitutes good pay for creating online content. I got an opportunity to make three times my hourly base pay for recording content. I also know that making content takes hours (designing creative flow; cueing; setup; and the bloody editing lol). I would love to know what others make for this. I am considering auditioning for Class Choreography but it's frustrating to not see compensation info since they require two unpaid auditions.  In the spirit of sharing - my current compensation for in class instructing is below. I would love to hear others' compensation in metro LA or NJ/NYC as well. 

For context I am in metro LA and a new instructor <1 year experience with two certifications - the 500 hour comprehensive CP and one through a private studio (also contemporary). 

In downtown LA at a CP franchise and as a new instructor this is what I was offered. I was fortunate that my classes were popular and almost always full so I averaged $40/hour. But teaching 12 people pilates is a lot for that amount so you have to really love it which I do. 

https://preview.redd.it/9s4hu059cb2c1.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=d63b41da970352fc528cf3af36f790d4c4abe2b7

I'm now at another studio which is run more like a private studio but does have \~10 locations in CA and NY. I went through their certification process as well (I hate how much we are required to spend on this) because I loved their approach and education on anatomy and movement. So training was 100% worth it to me because I get my kicks from learning. 

At my home studio (privately run) I make the following according to attendance: 1-5 $25; 6-7 $30; 8 $35; 9 $40; 10 $43. Technically higher as I make $43 for teaching 10 v 12 people. The attendance here is relatively and consistently high. But they rely a lot on class pass students and that makes teaching more challenging. They have corporate owned studios but they have really low attendance so you really just make $25/hour and shifts are usually 2 classes so I tend to avoid teaching there. They will also not pay you if you have 0 clients sign up for your first or last class of your shift and have 0 marketing efforts. So yeah no thanks. 

I'm hoping to work at a specific boutique studio where classes cost $100 for a group of 4. Their intense and you feel like you die a little each time lol so I love it. They require all instructors to have at least 1 year of teaching experience so once I get to that point I want to audition.  ",pilates,2023-11-24 15:26:37

Before doing the comprehensive training, you must get beginner and intermediate mat certified, I’ve done both now. I’m not sure where to go with this from here tho. I’ve been practicing on my friends, but I don’t have a studio to teach at. I’ve been searching for studios near me that are classical and have openings, the thing is that I feel like most places will want to hire instructors who are fully trained and not just mat 1 and 2, that or they want you train through their program. The comprehensive training isn’t until January and I’m not sure that I’ll be able to do all the pre reqs (taking a certain amount of private classes) before then, and also it’s during my busy season for my full time job where I’ll be working 60 hour weeks. So I guess my questions are 

1) how do I go about asking about trying out to teach at a studio I don’t even attend ( I feel like owners/managers will want to have at least seen your face before asking for a job) like what’s a script I can follow? 

2) if I can’t find a place to instruct at, do you guys think social media or virtual teaching is a viable thing to start?

At the moment I don’t play any music, but I do want to figure out a way to include this - perhaps sharing audio through Zoom - as I personally love it. However I’m aware not everyone enjoys background music, so it’d be nice to make it optional, plus licensing becomes an issue if you later upload on demand.

I don’t know about you, but it feels like teachers often have to scrabble around figuring this stuff out for themselves, so it’d be great to hear others’ tips and tricks! I’d be especially interested to hear from those who separately record live sessions to later upload to an on demand platform.

Hello everyone,

As a Pilates instructor, I'm reaching out for your help while I'm in the process of writing a book focused on Wall Pilates Workouts designed for women. The aim of this book is to offer support to all those women embarking on a transformative journey, seeking to regain muscle tone, and rediscover their lost physical fitness that has eluded them for some time.

My intention is not just to create a book solely featuring exercises. I aspire to address the most common issues associated with practicing Wall Pilates. That's why I'm writing this post—to gather insights from those who have already begun this journey or are planning to start soon. I would like to know which specific topics you'd like covered, in addition to the exercise descriptions. These topics might be typically overlooked in existing books but are fundamentally important.

Upon completion, I plan to offer a PDF version of the book to everyone contributing advice or sharing their personal experiences. Additionally, I will dedicate a thank-you page in the book, acknowledging those who have contributed. Thank you all for your support and input.

Best regards,

MaryAnne",pilates,2023-11-19 15:01:53

TL;Dr - Workout logging is different now after the latest Fitbit update. How are you handling things now?

I have a Fitbit Charge 5 and use an Android phone (Pixel 5, Android 14). 

I used to log my lagree workouts by selecting the ""Pilates"" exercise shortcut on my watch, then stopping/starting from the watch. This produced a reasonable ""calories burned"" in the app. However, if I retroactively logged a ""Pilates"" workout from the app, the calories burned were usually much lower (let's say half).

I used to log my reformer pilates workouts by selecting the ""Pilates"" exercise shortcut on my watch, then stopping/starting from the watch. This produced a reasonable ""calories burned"" in the app. If I retroactively logged a ""Pilates"" workout from the app, the calories burned were about the same as if I had logged from using the watch.

Even though both the lagree and pilates workouts were started from the watch using the same exercise shortcut, they produced different calories burned in the app. (Let's just say that lagree was about double the calories burned.) This makes sense, because lagree is a high intensity workout.

After the Fitbit update, there's no longer a ""Pilates"" exercise shortcut on the watch nor is there a ""Pilates"" option when manually logging in the app. 

As I understand it, I now am supposed to use the ""Workout"" option to manually log from the app. A few problems with that:

- There's no ""Workout"" exercise shortcut on the watch. (There's an ""Interval Workout"" option, but that does not work for pilates or lagree.)

- Because there's no there's no ""Workout"" exercise shortcut on the watch, I have to manually log my workouts from the app.

- When I manually log my workouts from the app, both pilates and lagree must be logged under ""Workout"" (since they removed Pilates as an option), so they produce the same calories burned.

I'd like to have a more accurate log of calories burned from exercise because I monitor CICO for weight management.",pilates,2023-11-18 00:06:45

1700101592.0,Pilates makes me extremely nauseous. Any tips?,"Every few years, I think, ""I should try pilates."" So, then I do, and I remember why I don't do pilates, because every single time, I feel extremely nauseous.  It's the same feeling as when I get car sick or plane sick (I get very motion sick), and it lasts for hours afterwards.  I looked online, and most articles are basically saying that if you're not in shape, you might get nauseous as you become more in shape.  Here's the thing though: I don't do pilates, but I run 5Ks, swim every week, workout everyday, compete in Irish dancing, garden everyday with varying levels of intensity, go hiking, walk with three kids in a stroller wagon most days of the week.  I would consider myself extremely fit. 

The only other explanation I can come up with, (knowing that I get motion sick, and it feels like that, and I have low blood pressure and I sometimes feel dizzy if I stand up too fast) is that it's some kind of vagus nerve overstimulation? 

I would love to do pilates, but it seriously is that if I try even 15 minutes of pilates exercises, I feel so nauseous that I have to go to bed and I'll feel better either the next day or after a few hours of a nap, which just isn't sustainable.

1700092702.0,Tower retrofit or the Springboard?,"I'm really missing the tower exercises and wanted to add a Tower/mat retrofit to my Balanced Body studio reformer  (it costs about $2600) or a wall-mounted springboard with the pull down bar add on (it costs about $950). There is the obvious price and space differences between the two, but I'm curious if others had thoughts on pros and cons outside of those.

For example, with the wall-mounted springboard, I can't do exercises that use the pull down bar to pass through the bars of the tower. Are there a lot of exercises where that's an issue? Other things to consider? 

I appreciate any thoughts.",pilates,2023-11-15 23:58:22

1699991237.0,Tower: worth it to add to reformer?,"I am loving my nearly new BB Studio reformer and great online classes. But I am considering adding the tower or tower and mat retrofit.  

 If you have (or have had) one or both of those add-ons, would you say you get equal value from reformer vs the tower or that it’s more like my guess of 80% reformer, 20% tower in terms of exercises you can do, availability of online classes, etc.  And if you have the mat/tower retrofit, how often do you use the mats?

I like the instability of the reformer that requires more core so would probably be more interested in workouts that combine reformer with tower.  I had the Allegro 1 with a tower 15+ years ago but at that time there were only a couple of videos available for the tower and no online classes then.

1.  how important is the height of a reformer?   Is 10” high enough (SPX height)? or do I need 15-16”?   
I have read that lower height might be safer for some balance positions.  Not sure if it limits lunge / hip flexor stretch Work when it is 10”—or if that is perfect?.    

2. would you recommend the STOTT Jumpboard or the STOTT trampoline (and why)?  Costco sells the trampoline w their home packages, but many other places only sell the jumpboard. Which do you prefer and why? 

 I am in my 70’s w some lumbar issues, and reformer work makes SUCH a difference. Previously I  had an Aeros chord reformer w the platform/ height extension.  I definitely want to move to a decent spring machine. I do not have issues getting up from the floor so I would be okay w 10” —just not sure how to understand the choice.

1699299126.0,do classical pilates instructors spend less time on class prep?,"Since the exercises in classical pilates are completed in a fixed order, does that mean instructors can spend less time (than contemporary instructors) on class prep/planning, since they don’t have to design a program each time?

This also got me thinking whether classical pilates is better for students/instructors with anxiety, since it is more organized and structured. I’m also curious whether the classical style would be less stressful for introverted/ socially anxious instructors, as I imagine there would be less variation in verbal cues.

Any insights are greatly appreciated:)",pilates,2023-11-06 19:32:06

Looking to spice up your mat routine? Check out this video from our studio!

We've been diving into mat-based exercises that replicate the Reformer experience, all thanks to the power of cognitive kinesthetic imagery. When you mentally conjure up the springs and leathers of a Reformer, you actually engage similar neural pathways, making your mat work nearly as effective.

This video flows through the following exercises: 

* Upper-Ab Curls
* Hundreds
* Shortspine
* Coordination
* Rolling Like A Ball (Stomach Massage)
* Swan
* T
* Backstroke
* Long Stretch
* Semi-Circle
* Chest Expansion
* Thigh Stretch
* Arm Circles

To keep it simple, he is blind, cant walk and cant talk either. Also has some mental developmental delay. So he hasn't been walking since birth and now at 12 years old he has gained alot of weight and fat. When he was younger he got some physiotherapy but due to circumstances we had to stop that. Now, he's hardly holding on to his knees, what i mean by that is he used to stay on his knees while eating on the dinner table, or when he wanted to look out of the window etc. but now he's having a hard time with that.   


Now, today i was looking up some beginner pilates to do by myself , and it looked easy so i tried doing it on my brother. it reminded me that when he used to get physiotherapy, the doctor used to do similar exercises on him.

By sick, I don't mean the mild sniffles where you can take some Dayquil and keep moving, but coming down feverish, chills, body aches, postnasal drip and sore throat where I can barely talk, coughing up bright green phlegm from the lungs, all that good stuff. Then it lasts for like 2 weeks.

With a regular office job, this is easier to manage because you can work from home, or just catch up on work after you return to the office. With something like Pilates where you have to be there in person and you're ""on"" the whole session? Not so much. You can't keep cancelling on your clients every 3 months unless you want them to get frustrated and find a different instructor.

I already do the common sense stuff: wash hands, exercise, eat well, take vitamins, get blood work done to make sure there are no vitamin deficiencies. I am not sleep deprived nor particularly stressed. It doesn't seem to matter.

Do any other instructors get sick this often? How do you manage? Surely I can't be the only one with bad luck when it comes to the immune system.",pilates,2023-10-29 14:38:21

1698498258.0,Instructor made me cry - am I being over sensitive?,"I’m still quite new to mat pilates, I’ve been going to a class about 3 times a week for a couple of months now. For a bit of context over the last year I’ve lost about 9 stone. I’m now physically a small size but I’ve still got a long way to go with getting fit and being strong. I probably look like I’d be a lot physically fitter than I actually am. 

I’ve absolutely loved learning pilates but I’m still getting to grips with the breathing. My classes swap over three different instructors who all do things a bit differently but one of them is very firm on breathing very slowly and all movements being very slow too. I try really hard to do what she says but I do find the breathing to be too slow for me and I either need to double breathe or my pace is faster because my breathing is (hope that makes sense!)

I’ve had a pretty crap week personally this week so this morning was struggling to keep my breathing slow. The instructor was shouting from the front that everyone needs to slow down but then came over and grabbed my feet and told me off (or it felt like anyway). She said I was breathing too fast so I tried to explain I’m trying to slow my breath but I’m struggling to go as slow as her pace and she said to me that I need to learn and I’m wasting my time with the exercise if I can’t breathe slower.

I was literally in tears. I didn’t want to finish the class so just went through the motions and then left at the end. I’ve decided I won’t go back to her class because I’m so upset with her but wanted to know if she’s right and I’m best off just sticking to other forms of exercise like yoga etc if I’m struggling to breathe to her pattern. I don’t seem to have this issue with other instructors but now I’m thinking is it just because I’m doing things wrong.

1698184174.0,Recommended split between mat and reformer pilates?,"I started doing pilates a month ago to rehab a herniated disc. I've done some pilates here and there in the past but now my routine is mostly pilates with a day of weight training and either yoga/dance as my cardio workout. In the past month, I did mat for 2 weeks then went on a 2 week work trip where I did reformer and fell in love with it. However, my gym back home only offers mat pilates and reformer is only offered in private lessons that go for $130/session which is hefty on top of the already expensive gym fee.

I don't know if I'm ready to switch to just going to a pilates studio as I like the variety a regular gym provides with weight, dance, yoga, hiit, etc. classes but I really did enjoy my time doing reformer.  Reformer seems really good for injury prevention and given how intense my workouts were on reformer but I never had any joint soreness nor back pain, I really do think it is something I should continue for at least 1-2 times a week even after I am done with my rehab period.

For people who do both mat and reformer pilates, do you have a recommended split where you see the most results? Do you do 1 and 1 class of each weekly? Switch off between mat and reformer weekly (ie one week all mat classes, next week all reformer)? Could I benefit from just doing reformer once or twice a month?

EDIT: thanks everyone for your responses. It seems like for those who do both, reformer is your main so me going 1-2x a month doesn’t really make sense. After sleeping on it and considering the responses, given I have just started with regularly doing pilates the past month, I will continue with mat (since that’s already included at my gym anyways) and see how I progress results wise. If I feel I am still getting the rehab experience I need and overall fitness improvement, great. If not, I will consider doing the private reformer sessions once a month until I get a raise and can afford going 1-2x at a separate studio. ",pilates,2023-10-24 21:49:34

I miss teaching and I am interested in earning a certification in Pilates (classical reformer and/Mat). I am a novice though and not sure where to start. How long are the programs? Are there different kinds, classical/contemporary, etc?

As someone who goes to the gym for a variety of classes (yoga, spin, Bodypump), class wasn't too hard nor too easy and I woke up the next day with a sore core, which was the cherry on top. 

Coming from a yoga background (I'm a certified teacher), the mind-body-breath connection I am so used to in my practice was amazing and I left class feeling the jellied muscles and sweat but without the cortisol surge and racing heart rate. 

Absolutely helps that I have a friend that comes with me to class, and the studio is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Loved the way the instructor conducted class too as there was no music and it just felt very soothing, minimalist and clean.

1698120025.0,"student in debt, re: how to become a pilates instructor","hello beautiful people!

I'm currently a student doing my undergraduate studies which are, expensive to say the least. I grew up dancing ballet at a professional studio, but was always at the more recreational level. Growing up this translated to a continuation of love for fitness through techniques that reminded me of ballet, namely mat pilates and barre. I currently work at a hospital in admin, and the job is high-stress, low-pay. Given that I'm accumulating student debt and the job is barely helping me pay my bills, I started to think about teaching part time. I feel like it's a lot more student friendly than my hospital job and if I were to work in studios in ""richer"" neighbourhoods, I could maybe make a pretty penny.

I've looked into many online certifications but I wanted to ask whether this community had any recommendations as to which certification is best (I would ideally like to be certified by next summer). My second question is whether anyone here taught at a studio while in school, and whether they found it was feasible/helpful financially. I'm not sure if I'm being naive, but I really think that getting out of the public hospital environment where everyone is immensely stressed (rightfully so), and being able to physically move my body while ""working"" will make me happier—and hopefully, will pay me better. For full transparency I'm making $21 (CAD) an hour at the moment, but it's shift work at maybe 4 days a week. And our breaks aren't covered, so I only get paid 7 hours. In total it barely covers groceries, car payments, if I want to go to the dentist, etc. 

If anyone would be able to share their experience, I would greatly appreciate it! Thank you :) ",pilates,2023-10-24 04:00:25
1698118416.0,Men doing Pilates,"I’m a guy who does pilates. I love it. I’ve had back issues for about a decade and pilates is the only thing that actually made my chronic back pain go away by strengthening my core. 

Anyway you all know how great pilates is. But I find as a guy I’m literally like the only man I know who does it and who appreciates it.

I used to do pilates at a yoga studio that did both classes and it was awesome. As a younger fit guy (early 30’s) at the time there would always be another guy in my class but usually much older. I can’t remember any time I’ve seen a fit younger guy in a pilates class.

This was all pre pandemic. I got the fittest I’ve ever been doing it consistently.

fast forward to post pandemic, I fell off majorly. Gained a bunch of weight. Now im working to get back in shape and I’ve signed up for a trial at a reformer Pilates studio that opened around the corner from my house. 

I’m loving it! It’s a beautiful studio and the classes are cool.

From here I’ve got 2 questions.

At this studio I’ve been going to classes for about 2 weeks regularly (3-4 times a week) and I am literally the only guy in any
Particular class. And all the classes are full. Once there was one other guy in a class. That’s literally it. 

I’m not really used to this and honestly I feel a bit uncomfortable walking into a studio full of women being the only guy. 

Mainly because I feel like maybe it’s not a space meant for me, and i really don’t want to kill the vibe or ruin the experience for women who expect it to be an all female class. 

I usually keep my head down, and try be super mindful of my energy and generally just try to be invisible. I’m also out of shape and not looking my best so my ego is basically non existent. Back in the day at the yoga studio when I was fit I was more aware of women looking at me and kind of enjoyed the attention.

For the Women who go to reformer pilates classes, does it bum you out when a lone dude shows up? Does it ruin the vibe? Does it make you feel uncomfortable? 

Generally I know these spaces are supposed to welcome all, and I basically use Pilates as physio trying to heal my back and I know it works. But I can’t help but feel as a het cis dude like maybe I’m taking up space where I shouldn’t. I would love to hear thoughts on this from the pilates community.

Here’s my other question 

I know pilates can really be a good workout and can get you fit as hell, but I feel like it’s often just too easy. Like teachers don’t push the students enough. The vibe I’m getting from
This particular studio is it all depends on the teacher. Do other people feel like pilates is often too easy? Not low impact, just straight up too easy where I don’t feel like I got a prepper work out from a 45 min session.

TLDR: as the only guy in most reformer classes, am I right in feeling like I’m maybe taking up space where I shouldn’t be in the primarily female space?

And Pilates sometimes is too easy. Is there a way to let teachers know I’m after a harder workout? I’ve had teachers who have just crushed me in the best way and I’m after that but I find it can be hard to find in the Pilates world. ",pilates,2023-10-24 03:33:36

I’m also a medical student and have a very busy schedule but manage to ensure I attend my classes at a Club Pilates. However, I’m lately getting bored with the same movements, yes I’ve changed spring loads, do my movements slower, but I feel with CP there’s so many rules & restrictions that instructors need to follow that clients don’t get challenged.

 I take 1.5 classes, 2.0 are scheduled only in the middle of the day and offered 2-3x a week, which is not ideal for someone who works, and is studying and doing clinical rotations (my days are 6am - 8pm).

I have tried looking to other Pilate studios but 1. Other studios towards the city is EXPENSIVE 2. I also live more towards the farmland area with my family (affordable than city living) and this causes CP to be the only “nearest” place with a 25 mins drive.

I am considering going through the teacher training program and I spoke with the lead teacher of the teacher training program this week where she explained how the training program works. It's a comprehensive course that is 450 hours and you have 12 months to complete. 

I can afford the tuition and while there will be a definite time commitment, at this point in my life it is something that I can deal with. For some reason, I am still nervous to commit, more because I am worried I am making a mistake, why, I don't know, other than me worried about my own abilities and that I won't be able to complete the program.

There’s an apprentice in the area that needed her teaching hours and is doing privates & small classes for the price of a Starbucks coffee. We’ve been working together a few times a week for whatever she needs her hours for and I’ve gotten to try various other apparatuses and have the classes adjusted to my strength level (tower, chair, reformer, and mat). I also joined a studio that has 3 different level group classes but requires everyone to do an intro class to be evaluated on their level and am going to work with the instructor to see which level is appropriate for me. 

I guess this just a testimony for smaller classes and/or private sessions.

1651662499.0,"Not to disappoint people, but I want to share with the sub that it's possible to NEVER see any physical changes from pilates.","So, I feel like a lot of people on this sub want to know when they're going to see physical changes and results with pilates and I want to share my own experience as someone who worked out A LOT for 4 years straight and NEVER truly saw physical changes to my body from pilates and diet alone. 

In college, I started as a dance major and was a pioneer for the pilates certification program at Mt college in my 3rd year. During the 4 years I went constantly, I took at least 4 days of classes with at least 2 1 hour classes a day (if not more) AND dropped in the pilates lab for lab hours at least once or twice a week for 30 minutes to 2 hours of additional practice (especially when we started student teaching). I will start with the fact that I am a shorter, stockier female who has never been thin or had a flat stomach. I remained the same weight and looked practically the same during those 4 years.

For me, what changed the most was all internal. I had way more abdominal strength and learned how to actively engage ALL of my abdominal muscles during certain exercises or dance on cue. I went from being terrified to try anything inverted in a dance class to loving being able to do handstands because now I could reach a point where my abdominal muscles carried my body more easily. I had way more control over my body. As a naturally clumsy person, I found that I was able to learn how to fall more safely and felt stronger/like I wasn't going to break a wrist from falling which gave me more motivation to try things that scared me. I was able to do more ballet work because I could easily stabilize on one leg. And most importantly, my biggest gripe with my body is that I've always felt like I'm built like a turtle in that I have a very short neck but big ass head and broad shoulders so I naturally crunch my cervical spine. With pilates, I was able to get focused exercises and stretches to both lengthen and support true cervical spine elongation. Not to mention the fact that my posture was finally gorgeous and I did not suffer from the back and ankle problems that I do now. I never saw physical changes, but I absolutely felt the benefits of it.

And honestly? I know that I'm not the only person who experienced this. I know quite a few people who I did both programs with that said the same thing. We all saw immense benefits from doing pilates but we didn't believe that we saw the type of results I feel like a lot of people on this sub are looking to see. 

This is not everyone's experience. A lot of people DO see physical results from pilates, but as someone who worked out consistently for years and worked with people who did the same, I wanted to just share that it is possible that you'll never see the physical results you want to see with pilates and diet alone.

And that's okay. 

But, don't let it disappoint you.",pilates,2022-05-04 11:08:19

1673367920.0,"Chavie Lieber interviewed me for her article on Melissa Wood tepperberg (MWH) in the WSJ, she manipulated my words and labels me as a 'Pilates Purist' for speaking up against MWH's misleading and dangerous Pilates advice","I so hope this post gets upvoted so people see it when they search for Chavie Lieber and MWH.

A couple of weeks ago, Chavie Lieber messaged me to ask if she could interview me for her article on MWH, I agreed and the article is now published: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/melissa-wood-tepperberg-health-11673275908](https://www.wsj.com/articles/melissa-wood-tepperberg-health-11673275908)

This is the part Chavie wrote about me:

>Some  Pilates purists believe Ms. Wood-Tepperberg does not hold tight to the  century-old method. James Davis, a pilates instructor and physical  therapist in the U.K. who moderates Reddit’s Pilates forum, said he  doesn’t think Ms. Wood-Tepperberg teaches enough fundamentals, such as  spine safety or modifications.   
>  
>Still,  he commended Ms. Wood-Tepperberg for helping “thousands of people  improve their health and look after their mental and physical selves.” A  spokesperson said Melissa Wood Health organizes videos by beginner,  intermediate and advanced to guide viewers.

&#x200B;

Compare that to what I wrote for Chavie's interview:

&#x200B;

>How would you say MWH has differentiated herself within the Pilates world?  


>The  'term' Pilates lost its trademark and came into the public domain in  2000. This has allowed lots of Contemporary styles of Pilates to  flourish; BASI Pilates, Polestar Pilates, STOTT Pilates, Peak Pilates to  name just a few. They have taken what Joseph Pilates and gone in their  own unique ways, while honouring Joseph's method.
>Unfortunately, this  opened the door to influencers who use the term 'Pilates' with utter  disregard for the Pilates method, they just want success. This is what  MWH has done, and this is how Mellisa has differentiated herself in the  Pilates world; she's brilliant at marketing.  



>Are you a subscriber; do you enjoy her workouts? Why (or why not)?  


>I'm  not a subscriber and I would advise anyone interested in starting  Pilates to avoid MWH. At best she's misleading, at worst she's  dangerous. I researched MWH after a Redditor asked their opinion of her  app. From her marketing, I was expecting to see a professional guide her  users through the fundamental exercises such as learning how to breathe  laterally, how to articulate their spine safely, modifications to keep  users safe etc. What I saw wasn't Pilates, it was generic workouts with  the Pilates label slapped on them. Some of her made-up exercises were  dangerous and could lead to injuries.
>What makes it worse is that MWH  markets herself as a qualified Pilates instructor; she should know  better, if she does, she doesn't care.
>I delved deeper, looking for  any information on her qualifications, I couldn't find any. Professional  Pilates instructors that post workouts online tend to be proud to show  off their qualification information, the fact that Mellisa keeps hers  hidden is a red flag, a common tactic for online influencers that  haven't got a reputable qualification.  




>Melissa's message is that 15 to 20 minutes a day is enough for a workout, is that something you agree with?  


>Yes  and no, it depends what you're trying to achieve. If you're looking to  keep your body mobile, 15-20 can be enough. If you're looking to build  stamina, add 2-3, 1 hour long sessions a week. If you're looking to lose weight, calories in vs calories out is the most important factor,  burning more calories than you consume is what decreases fat, Pilates  tends to focus on slow, controlled movements correctly so you may want  to incorporate HIIT or resistance training into your workout routine.
>I  advise all my clients to roll out their mat and exercise every day,  even if it's just for 5 minutes; consistency is key to seeing results  with Pilates.  
>  
>
>It's not the time or the exercises you do that  necessarily get results in Pilates, HOW you do the exercises is the  biggest factor. If you practice with poor form, you reinforce it, and  it's easy to unknowingly perform Pilates exercises incorrectly  practising at home. If you're new to Pilates, take some private lessons  with a professional instructor when you can, you can take what they  teach you about your own body and use it in your home practice. If going  to a studio isn't an option, lots of professional instructors offer  online sessions through webcams.Pilates can have a social image that  only skinny people with lean, toned muscles in fashionable yoga pants  do it, this is not true. You will find all shapes and size in Pilates  studios, many people turn to Pilates to overcome pain and injuries, they  may have no intention of sculpting the stereotypical Pilates body, and  that is fine. No matter what shape or size you are, the Pilates world  welcomes you and your body.  




>Have you heard any negative feedback about Melissa on the platforms, and if so, is it warranted?  


>There was a controversy about attending a maskless party during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic: [https://social-post.com/call-outs/melissa-wood-not-as-transparent-as-you-think/](https://social-post.com/call-outs/melissa-wood-not-as-transparent-as-you-think/)

>
>Somebody posed a genuine question on her Facebook group asking about her qualifications, their comment was deleted.
>I've  heard from some of her subscribers that she has a weird obsession with  food, spouts nonsensical diety advice and they suspect she has an eating  disorder.
>Her success comes from her husband's money and she has a  team that heavily curates her online persona, they delete any critical  comments.-This is just what I've been told, I don't know how true any of this is.  
>
>
>Melissa  has helped thousands of people improve their health and look after  their mental and physical selves, I commend her for that.  With  regards to Pilates, I've heard similar opinions to my own; it's not  Pilates, and I think this criticism is warranted. If you're going to  market your content as Pilates, you have a responsibility to be  transparent with what you are teaching.  MWH has a huge influence on the  public, it's disappointing to see her misleading so many people.  Melissa can't play naivety here, with her wealth, she can take any  Pilates training course she wants and has a team working for her.
>My negative opinion against MWH is about semantics; she should not be labelling her content as 'Pilates'.  


 
>Do  you think her fitness app and platform in general, or do you think it  could fizzle out if people get sick of working out online?  



>I  think it will continue to grow, just like the online Pilates industry  is. Professional Pilates instructors are sharing the top Google results  with influencers who are desperate to be the most popular, it can be  difficult for the average person to differentiate between the two.  
> 
>
>If  subscribers are enjoying MWH's platform, good for them, do what works  for you. Though if anyone is looking to start Pilates at home, there are far better online resources to choose from:

1663787093.0,“Pilates” body,"Pilates will not give you a new body.  It will strengthen the body you already have.  It will give you functional mobility and support your joints and spine. It will improve your balance and coordination and breathing. It will help you learn to connect your body and mind. It can reduce stress. It’s amazing.  But it will not make you long and lean and dancer like unless you’re naturally built like that. It can’t really give you some hourglass figure with a prominent ass. Genetics shape our structure.   Pilates is a wonderful body conditioning method, a strength building form of body weight exercises on the mat and resistance training on the equipment.  It’s not shape morphing magic.   

I really encourage people to enjoy the real benefits of Pilates.  Focus on health and functional fitness. Pilates can make positive changes in your body even at age 70 and 80! Increasing spinal mobility and support is something that will improve your quality of life.  A snatched waist just won’t do that. 

As someone who’s been doing Pilates and teaching it for decades I wish that the real benefits were more valued and more focused on. Joe himself said it was a method to improve your quality of life.

1672271669.0,Strong healthy bodies,"Pilates is designed to give you a strong healthy body.  That looks different on everyone!  

So many of the “Pilates” influencers are not actually qualified teachers but they’ve got extremely thin and muscular bodies. This has been termed “toned” yet for the majority of women achieving that look will not happen through healthy lifestyle.  Over exercising and under eating is not healthy. But many influencers are doing that. 

I went to college for dance. We were dancing 3-5 hours a day. Some of us also did Pilates and swam or other exercise.  Only a couple of the women looked remotely like these influencers and they were just naturally built like that!  We were all incredibly strong and far more active than average. 

This trend of wanting to be rail thin with every muscle showing is seriously dangerous. It’s not a reasonable goal. 

I love pilates and have been doing it for 35 years. It offers so many benefits and to fixate on looking a certain way really misses the fundamental purpose of building and enjoying health. We can all look and feel our best but that looks different for everyone.  

When looking for a teacher focus on their teaching skills.   Not their body. A great body doesn’t make a great teacher. And over exercising and under eating is disastrous for your health.",pilates,2022-12-28 23:54:29

I’ve been working out for 4 days a week vs 5-6.  I’m doing B the Method, reformer pilates, and cardio.  I have never felt or looked better. I don’t think my body is retaining water. I can enjoy splurging a little with minimal exercise and remain the same weight. This is so new to me. It’s like more is less?!

At the gym however (where there are other trainers and people) she mentioned to others I saw a big improvement from pilates. It was as if you told people the world was flat lol. They really belittled it, and said that aesthetically i would not see changes (which is false cause my posture has improved a ton and I have better ab definition). My physio apologized for the comments others made (totally not her fault). 

I am noticing online a huge gym (weightlifting) girls vs pilates girls beef and i really don’t get why people have to be so campy.

Anyways, i wanted to know if others have noticed this recent “vilification” of pilates since it has become more mainstream

Every person can benefit from Pilates and become stronger and more functional in their body, no matter what they look like. I have many clients who have bigger bodies and are incredibly strong and healthy.  I have clients who are thin and toned but have many issues and struggles with functional mobility.   Your body shape is not an indicator of your health or fitness. 

Many of the people we see who are fitting the idea of the Pilates body are getting that way through over exercising and under eating. I just saw on the forma Pilates sub that she posted what she eats every day and it was disturbing!  I personally want people to understand that Pilates will give you your best body, not make you look like the lady in the video your following.

1652841045.0,PSA: SolidCore is NOT Pilates,"I've been seeing this misconception everywhere lately - Instagram, TikTok, in addition to Reddit - that the Lagree variations (SolidCore, SLT) are Pilates. These modalities are NOT Pilates. The instructors are NOT Pilates instructors. If you attend these classes, you are NOT doing Pilates. 

Many people don't understand what it means to be a Certified Pilates Instructor - to teach on the Reformer (as well as the other equipment), you must complete a comprehensive certification, usually around 500 hours total, which can take a year or more. There are hundreds of exercises to learn in the Pilates repertoire. This is part of why Pilates (true Pilates) is so expensive; the instructors are more thoroughly trained than any other fitness modality. The SolidCore/Lagree instructors are trained in as little as 1 weekend and do NOT learn any of the Pilates repertoire nor do they have any anatomical training. 

Just wanted to clear this up for those who might be new to Pilates because it can be confusing. But just using a Reformer or a Reformer-like apparatus doesn't mean that you're doing Pilates.",pilates,2022-05-18 02:30:45
1686667378.0,Finished my 150th reformer session today! Here are 12 things that I've noticed:,"I just completed by 150th reformer class! I've been averaging about 2.5 classes a week over 15 months, and I figured I would share what I've noticed over this time.

First of all, some details about me:

I'm 6'3"", male, 46 years old with poor posture, terrible flexibility, relatively trim but not skinny, and due to rotator cuff injuries and a bad knee, I've never been able to stick with many workouts for long. I want to be fit, but no matter what I do, my injuries inevitably flair up and I lose whatever progress I've made. 

So, I decided to try Pilates. Here is what I've learned:

1) I've never even come close to injuring myself during Pilates. Having great instructors coupled with ease of modifications has made Pilates feel very safe. Plus, I've actually gotten a ton of mobility back in my shoulders, and now I can do lots of upper body exercises (like ""Draw the Sword), which at the beginning, I couldn't do at all. My shoulders definitely aren't ""fixed"", but due to the precision within which I can now move them, I know how to easily avoid problematic angles.

2) I haven't lost any weight. If anything, my waist is a little thicker. But my eating habits haven't changed, and weight loss was never a big part of the goal.

3) My body looks much better. Despite not losing weight around my waist, my upper body is far more defined, my shoulders look bigger, better posture, etc.

4) My posture has improved by about 40%. Literally people have been telling me about my hunch since I was middle school. Pilates is literally the first thing I've ever done in my life that has helped. Suddenly, it all makes sense. It's impossible ""remind yourself"" to stand up straight. You simply have to strengthen all aspects of your core, and you WILL stand up straighter.

5) I'm somewhat more flexible. I can pretty much touch my toes now, which I couldn't ever really do before. Still, I think I would have expected more improvements in flexibility.

6) Sitting is much more comfortable. I went to my nephew's graduation last week, and we were sitting on bleachers, and I noticed how I was naturally sitting up with my back straight. Bleachers were, for the first time ever, relatively comfortable.

7) Sorry if this is too much info, but sex is significantly better.

8) Yesterday, my phone fell into the backseat of the car, and I noticed that I was literally able to twist my body at the waist in order to reach and pick it up. In the past, I would have had to literally get up on my knees and turn myself fully around to get it. 

9) It's frickin' expensive. Seriously, if I wasn't seeing such amazing improvements, I would have quit this long ago. An average of $35 per class is... a lot. My wife is really cool, but even she raises an eyebrow at how much money this costs. 

10) Even after 150 classes, my hips are still super tight. Sitting up straight with my legs straight forward is very, very hard on my lower back.

11) I'm 6'3"", and sometimes the reformer is a bit too small for me. I'd say I'm only really affected on about 5% of the exercises, but I do wish the machine were a little larger.

12) I'm sleeping better!

All in all, it has been life-changing for me. Maybe I'll share another update at 300 classes! Thanks for reading.",pilates,2023-06-13 14:42:58

1695395721.0,Update: Signed up to become a pilates teacher while high on shrooms. I have no athletic or teaching background. What did I just sign up for?,"[Update to this post](/r/pilates/comments/11pnfc4/signed_up_to_become_a_pilates_teacher_while_high/)

So it's been six month in since I started the program. It's way tougher than I imagined, but I learn a bunch of stuff that I wouldn't have learned otherwise and I think it will help me with my goals in the future. I showed up to practice with the other student who reached and she was pretty cool. Turns out another student eventually joined as well. These were both fit girls with extensive yoga and fitness backgrounds - and then there's me.

I was panicking for our first test where we have to teach in person and we get judged by a proctor. We all started preparing for the test. There's a benefit to working with students who are smarter than you because they can advise you and correct you on what you're doing. I was the ""student"" for both other students and got private pilates training for free lol, and got to be their students for their tests.

I was looking for more people to practice teaching with, and I ended up knowing a lot more people in my gym than otherwise. Started talking to personal trainers and stuff. I told my own pilates instructor, who I have been going for a while, about going through the program and she was happy for me. The pilates studio was also looking to hire, and the manager asked me if I am interested in working for them. I adjusted my glasses and saw that she looked really eager. I thought that was a crazy idea. It didn't make sense to do this when I lack a fitness background and just got into the program because I got high on shrooms. Talking to clients for hours on end a day? Insane. I am a nerdy keyboard jockey who can't even talk to girls. The manager was still looking at me. ""Will you apply?""

""Of course!"" I blurt out.

So we set up an interview for later, and I was getting ready for our second exam. I was super panicked about it because it felt like I didn't learn everything yet to pass. I took a microdose of shrooms to get zen and started doing the exam with the proctor watching. I surprisingly passed (barely). The proctor reassured me that the real learning begins when you actually start teaching anyway.

The other student who reached out to me first, during a practice she started talking about the other yoga people she knows. They like to do shrooms and she got interested in some shroom ceremony a guy in her community offered, because he's a shaman or something. I told her what shrooms are like and offered to find her some for cheaper (never admitted I have them myself) or that I could be a trip sitter. I warned her to start small because it will be like blasting off on a rocket if she takes a lot lol. She's definitely interested in trying but holding off to think about it further as she never done mind altering drugs. Maybe I'll get a new trip buddy.",pilates,2023-09-22 15:15:21
1620234936.0,"Pilates is a practice, not a performance","After over 30 years spent doing Pilates I often barely recognize it as it’s presented to the general public now.  “Sculpt” and “burn” and promised fast results are everywhere.  I have a different experience and a different approach. 

Pilates isn’t about performing.  It’s not even about getting “in shape”, and certainly not a quick fix.  And if your goal is to be “in shape” for swimsuit season you probably need to start in December, not now.  And if making your body look a certain way is your goal, that’s fine. But that truly takes many hours a week of practice. Ask yourself if that’s how you want to spend all your free time. An hour of Pilates a week won’t make you look like a dancer... dancers train many many hours a week for years to look like they do! 

Pilates is a practice.  A lifelong practice for improving your life.  Posture, balance, coordination, strength and flexibility are some benefits.  But focus, awareness, stress relief and concentration are also benefits.  The mindbody aspects are very vital to the practice.  How you feel and move are far more important than what you’re body looks like.  Being thin and toned aren’t indicative of being healthy and happy.  The truth is many people who present themselves as models of healthy living workout too much and eat too little and create unrealistic and unreachable ideals that most people won’t reach with a truly healthy life.  

 Pilates was designed for health of body and mind.  Doing fancy advanced exercises isn’t right for everyone and they don’t give you better results.  Just simply practicing with consistency will give you results.  And practice doesn’t need to make “perfect”.  The practice itself is the reward.  Of course you will improve and the more you progress the more you’re capable of but it’s not some ladder to perfection and if you can’t do teaser you’re failing. Some people should not even  to aim for teaser. People have different bodies and the beauty of Pilates is that you can adapt it to your body.  Find what works best for you and practice. Don’t worry about how it looks or if the “right” muscle is engaging. Working with a skilled teacher is invaluable but if that’s not possible just practice on your own. Let the practice be the end result.  Not a size.  Not a perfect exercise. Getting done with your routine and feeling great, being able to live your life with less pain and more ease is far better results than fitting into some special number size or being able to do a fancy exercise.  Do it for yourself and cherish the benefits you create.",pilates,2021-05-05 17:15:36

Whether you’re doing a six week Pilates-based body buster boot camp type thing, one you tube class, or have a lifetime of intense training you are doing great. Keep it up! Keep moving and ENJOY it! No one is allowed to tell you the reason you are doing pilates is invalid or wrong or not the point.",pilates,2021-07-09 18:54:18

1674227019.0,WHY TF ARE REFORMER PILATES CLASSES SO DAMN EXPENSIVE,"Idk what it’s like in other countries but where I’m at they all expect you to pay around 800$ for a LIMITED number of classes per month (8-12 if you’re pushing it). Which is fucking insane. They even go as far as excluding reformer pilates from their normally priced packages and create new ones with ridiculous prices exclusively for reformer pilates. And the best part? each time you renew your subscription you pay the exact same fucking price. So if i want to stick to it all year long I’d have to pay 9600 FUCKING dollars!!? Is this normal? Am i being overly dramatic? Is reformer pilates only for the rich and bougie?? If there are any coaches on here could you at least explain why they price their classes that high?? I just wanna be a pilates girlie but this is making me want to give up

Edit: Alright thank you to all those who took the time to **kindly** break things down for me, I might’ve been a lil fired up I will admit but it was only out of despair because reformer pilates really does align with my goals and health requirements (and yes I have searched more than one place, I’ve practically rang up every studio in my city so it’s not a matter of having “not searched enough”). I’ve already known it was going to be a tad more expensive than what I’m used to and was more than willing to pay the price, but as some of you have noticed these prices truly are abysmal even for a high end range (and to those asking yes, I am talking about US dollars). I believe they are so in part due to reformer pilates being relatively new in my country (which I have not disclosed for privacy reasons but thank you to those who wished to help in asking) and some of these studios are genuinely extortionate. I believe I’ve aired my grievances and got the necessary answers so I will settle for mat pilates for the time being. Thank you",pilates,2023-01-20 15:03:39

1625756611.0,The truth about “Classical” vs “Contemporary” - my research about the Pilates industry,"
How a retired journalist went straight to the dark side of Pilates

During a 14-year journalistic career I learned to be skeptical of whatever I was being told. Every public figure and “expert in the field” that I interviewed had their own version of “the truth”, carefully underlining certain facts while skillfully omitting or downplaying others in order to bolster their narrative. Using politically correct, gimmicky language was another staple. And, of course, every one of them would accuse their opponents of doing exactly what they were doing!

I eventually burned out on journalism and decided to reignite my passion for teaching movement. I figured that getting people’s bodies twisting and turning is much better than spinning yet another news story into their brains. But given my vast experience in doing the latter, I discovered the dark side of Pilates a lot quicker than I found out all the intricacies of the Teaser.

I began my formal education by doing exercises exactly as Joseph Pilates prescribed in his book “Return to Life through Contrology”, then graduated to YouTube videos. Realizing I needed professional coaching, I enrolled into Polestar Pilates.

The instructors explained why Polestar’s so-called “Contemporary” approach is very different from “Classical”. They explained that Polestar founder Brent Anderson broke new ground by incorporating the Moshe Feldenkrais movement method and elements of physical therapy to help beginners.

But as I was learning to move my body in new ways, the old cynical media guy in my mind was signaling that something was off. The biomechanics and movement lessons were very interesting. It was also no surprise that the teachers were towing the company line by pushing various workshops, seminars and Anatomy Trains courses.
 
What caught my attention, however was the way the mentors preached the Polestar methodology as “the only right way” and sold themselves as “innovators” in the world of Pilates, while taking subliminal swipes at the competition from the “classical” school of thought. Experienced fitness trainers were falling for it hook line and sinker, expressing sorrow for “teaching people the wrong way” all these years. I was a rookie exercise instructor but a veteran cynical media guy, so I wasn’t easily fooled. Gimmicky language? Check. Omitting key facts about other schools? Check. Making it sound like there’s only one absolute truth in the world of Pilates? Check!

I signed up for Pilates Anytime to see for myself. The site offered classes from teachers who were supposed to be the best in the industry. All classes were divided into “classical” and “contemporary” categories.

The “classical” guys all did the same 34 exercises, which Joseph Pilates called “Contrology” many decades ago. Some even dared to change up their “original order” and add a few wrinkles, while others taught “archival” classes, doing things “exactly like Joe did” in terms of technique. The only thing missing was the jumpy sped up black and white film to add to the “vintage” feel of a bygone era.

Each “contemporary” Pilates school meanwhile had slightly different variations of the same pre-Pilates exercises I learned at Polestar. So much for the “unique” and “innovative” approach that each of them advertised! I dug deeper into that. After getting my investigative journalist hat back out of the closet despite a career change, I found all the skeletons of the Pilates business there as well.

During our introductory course, Polestar teachers briefly mentioned a lawsuit which cancelled the “Pilates” trademark and made it a generic term for an exercise method, much like “Karate” or “Yoga”.

I found out that after Joseph Pilates died in 1967, none of his teachers wanted to run his failing business. Eventually Romana Kryzanowska agreed to try and keep the studio going. Since she had lived in Peru since 1944, she had no idea about studio operations. During her time she seduced a series of men to assist her; the final one was Sean Gallagher. Since she had fraudulently registered the name Pilates as a trademark circa 1988, she and Sean Gallagher were able to sue at least ten studios/companies and threaten about 100 studio owners with Cease & Desist legal notices.  Of course, Joe himself always called his method “Contrology"".

Eve Gentry— Joe’s first teacher— moved to Santa Fe in 1968 the year after his death. She soon realized that the dancer bodies and the few elite clients at the New York studio were different from the public who didn’t have the flexibility and athleticism to do Contrology. The original repertoire was nearly impossible for typical Americans whose idea of “Corkscrew” was opening up a bottle to go with an extra-large meal, rather than twisting their increasingly obese bodies upside down.
 
Eve Gentry and not Brent Anderson was actually the first to incorporate the Feldenkrais movement method into Pilates, in order to teach clients basic functional movements before tackling the advanced work. A grainy video from October 1991 clearly showed her teaching a workshop organized by The Institute for the Pilates Method. Polestar’s Brent Anderson, BASI Pilates founder Rael Isacowitz and others from major Pilates schools were in attendance. They were learning the same moves I learned at Polestar nearly three decades later. 

No wonder every “contemporary” Pilates school had the same repertoire!

The Institute for the Pilates Method offered the first ever organized Pilates certification program in 1992 which is why Romana and Sean sued them. Plus, they filed a Trademark Cancellation Action in 1993.    Eventually they changed their name to “PhysicalMind Institute” to remove the other “P-word” from its name.

Romana and Gallagher continued bullying others who dared use the “Pilates” name too, until they met their match in Ken Endelman from Balanced Body Inc. The owner of the largest Pilates equipment manufacturer filed a class-action countersuit, and the courts cancelled the trademark on October 20th, 2000. It is extremely rare for the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office to cancel a trademark since the fees support this bureau.
  
The losers of the case immediately branded their Pilates as “classical” and continued teaching the old-school version of the method. Those who attended Eve Gentry’s workshops became known as “contemporary”.

In the name of journalistic integrity, let’s drop the gimmicks and call things by their proper names! “Classical” is nothing more than Pilates by the trademark losers. It teaches a complex routine from the Middle Ages, with enough forward flexion exercises to bend a stone statue in half. Pro athletes, dancers and other impressive physical specimen might be able to do it, but not “the average Joe”.
“The original Joe”, who created this method, was a prolific inventor. If these purists wanted to really “do what Joe did”, they would be inventing new devices and equipment, while always looking to improve the exercises. Thus, “contemporary” Pilates is ironically doing a better job of “preserving Joe’s legacy” of innovation.
 
That’s because “Contemporary” is essentially smart Pilates from Eve Gentry’s lineage. They use a repertoire more appropriate for the always-texting, always-sitting, neck-forward, office-working person of today. It features simple movements and lots of extension, side bending and twisting which their spines don’t get to enjoy otherwise. There is also much needed standing Pilates work and many new “props” and inventions, including from the certification pioneers at Physical Mind Institute.

Nowadays Pilates is big business, and most other schools, including Polestar, adhere to the certification standards of the Pilates Method Alliance (PMA), which was formed shortly after the trademark case. I didn’t even want to think of the type of political games and corporate battles going on in there, but the cynic in me assumed the worst.

I got a taste of it when taking my certification exam with Polestar, however. It seemed like I was taking a college-entry multiple choice SAT test. Standardized trick questions about exercises and anatomy only tested my ability to take the test itself, rather than finding out what I can do thinking on my feet. Not what I was used to, after running through fluid 24/7 live news environments with a million moving parts. I still passed the exam and now I’m ready to continue my Pilates journey with no more illusions as to what the business is all about.

Over these past two years, I went through the magic circle of life: quitting a jaded industry, getting into a new one, only to find the same dark underbelly of politics, spin, and gimmicks, but with a more athletic flavor.",pilates,2021-07-08 15:03:31
1639697219.0,Why people tend to be dismissive of pilates?,"My dietitian was extremely surprised that I gained 1kg of muscle mass in one month only doing pilates (2x per week with an amazing instructor) and on a diet.

I ignored all her non-food tips/opinions, since she's a dietitian, and I got amazing results doing pilates.

So why people tend to be dismissive of pilates? Everytime I look for opinions about pilates, even here on reddit, people keep saying that pilates isn't enough or is limited.

1693028646.0,ReformRX update and word of caution,"update: I filed an official complaint with the attorney general office for my state, I encourage others who had a bad experience with them to do the same  


Sorry for the long post but I wanted to give a timeline and update on my experience with ReformRX so that anyone who considers ordering or who is still waiting on their order can hear my experience.

ReformRX timeline

Original order: January 21, 2022

Expected delivery at time of order was May 2022

First delay: they email us all at the beginning of May saying delivery will happen in September - then we hear nothing from them for months

Second delay: they let us know in September, now it will be January - again we go back to no messages 

Third delay: we get into December and are notified of yet another delay, saying now it will be March, they send us little gift of grippy socks as a thank you for patience and claim they will do virtual mat workouts weekly until delivery and get better about communicating going forward 

After this: they do the workout thing like 3 times then stop, we get no other communication 

Fourth delay: I contact them in March asking for an update, I’m told now it looks like it will be end of April, then I hear nothing

Fifth delay: I contact again in April as I have still heard nothing, I’m finally told after sending multiple emails and attempts to call that I will be on the shipment that arrives in July

During this time frame I noticed that they continued to regularly post on social media about everything they were doing, filming classes, opening a studio, taking new orders, etc. But nothing ever about how they were going to prioritize fulfilling orders for everyone who had been waiting for over a year. They started blocking comments and deleted others because it was mostly frustrated customers posting.

I posted the warning on Reddit to try to save others from getting into this mess. These posts said nothing but the truth about my experience. However I received an email from Neal with Reform telling me to remove them immediately or he would cancel my order. This should have been another flag for me to just say enough is enough, ask for a refund and be done. But I had waited so long and I really was excited, so I did what he asked and deleted it. Apparently he could still find the title of the post in Google search results if he specifically looked for it, something I have zero control over, but he still claimed I needed to do more to get it removed. He told me I needed to email Reddit and ask for it to be completely removed or he would not give me information on my order. Again, this should have been a giant red flag for me, but I did as he asked and moved on. 

Then finally I got an email a few weeks later that the reformer had actually shipped and would arrive in a few weeks. I was so hopeful this would almost be over.

Sixth delay: the reformer arrives but they discover due to my calling that the tablets did not get shipped so they have to reship from Europe, ETA 2 weeks

Seventh delay: tablets finally arrive, but sit at the warehouse for a week before the logistics company does anything with them. Then I finally get information that they are supposedly taking them to the final mile partner and then can be delivered. Final mile provider contacts me to schedule delivery on August 12, finally seems like this will all be over. Until I get a voicemail on August 11th saying they have to cancel because the tablets are not there and they don’t know where they are.

I left a voicemail for the logistics company and emailed them asking what was going on and to please keep me updated on the situation. It was a Friday afternoon so nobody was available, but I was hoping this would at least help it be on their radar to handle first thing Monday. On Monday I got a one line response back from the logistics company stating that yes the tablets were lost and they were looking for them. That was it, no additional information or plan for what they would do if they didn’t track them down. So again, I was in limbo with no idea when I would get my $5k reformer that I had waited almost 2 years for. I was frustrated to then open Facebook that night and see them continue to post articles and videos of the reformer that is supposedly so wonderful, but never gets delivered. They delete all of the comments on their social media because of all the angry people, so I figured I’m still going to comment about my frustration and I left a note saying I’m frustrated that my reformer still hasn’t been delivered and the logistics company has now lost a piece, which was entirely accurate.

The next morning I got a call from Neal, the founder, telling me that the final mile delivery company no longer wanted to deliver to me and were claiming I harassed them. This was pretty shocking to me considering I had done nothing other than send an email asking about the status and calling to ask, I was polite and just hoping for info, which seems extremely reasonable considering it’s an expensive item I had been waiting a long time for. Then he goes on to say they saw my post and tried to tell me it was illegal, which sorry no it isn’t, but I apologized and said I was angry at the continued lack of information and delays. He then claimed they had found the tablets, which nobody had told me, but they weren’t scheduling a delivery for me because the final mile carrier didn’t want to deal with me. This made me extremely upset to hear because I had waited so long, after a long conversation he told me he would try to convince them to deliver but I should not contact anyone going forward and he would follow up via email. I said ok please let me know as soon as possible.

I didn’t contact anyone on Tuesday, I heard nothing back from Neal. So I emailed him on Wednesday morning asking for an update. I requested that he either give me a delivery date within the next week or refund me immediately if he was not going to deliver to me. I heard nothing from him on Wednesday. Something still didn’t seem right, because when I had one conversation with the final mile carrier about the lost tablets they seemed very kind and it seemed odd they would have been offended by me reaching out to them. I decided to email them an apology for anything I did to offend them and said I hoped they would decide to deliver to me, but if not I respect that decision and was sorry for the miscommunication or misunderstanding. The next morning I got an email back from the delivery company stating they had no idea what I was talking about, they didn’t have the tablets yet, had not spoken with Reform at all, and never said I harassed them. They said they would try to figure out what was going on. I thanked them, but then got my email chain interrupted by the original logistics company telling me not to contact the final mile carrier anymore and to wait for Neal or them to followup. At this point, I was extremely frustrated by the lies, accusations and the run around I was getting from Reform. 

A few minutes after that Neal finally responded to my email from Wednesday saying that he spoke to the company and they agreed to deliver my reformer. Part of me wanted to be thrilled and say ok, yes schedule it now. But then the logical side of me stepped in and told him to cancel my order and please process my refund immediately. At this point I simply couldn’t allow myself to give this company my money. They had terrible customer service the entire time waiting, they threatened me for posting accurate information on Reddit about the experience with them, and now they had lied and accused me of harassment. I’m sure it’s a nice piece of equipment, but I couldn’t go through with the purchase. I also have very little confidence based on how I was treated that I would receive any timely support should the reformer have issues in the future. 

They agreed to refund me and thankfully they actually did it quickly, but that is pretty much the only thing they responded to and handled in a timely manner the entire time. I’m sad that I had to cancel, but ultimately I think it’s better for me to find something else. Sorry for the long winded story, but I wanted to share my experience.

I am sure they may see this and be angry, but this is the truth and I feel like I should share. These reformers are now even more expensive and people should know who they are dealing with.

1692649322.0,Filmed today’s session after 3 months of consistent Yoga + Pilates = brutal wake up call,"Damn, what a necessary evil 😅

Been doing yoga and Pilates 4-5 times a week for 3 months now. I’ve noticed myself getting stronger and more flexible. In the right lighting I see abs peeking through. I feel calm and healthy.

But: I filmed myself practicing today for the first time. I do home workouts and can’t normally see myself. I thought my form was generally ok. 

WRONG! Watching the video back I have a terrible sway in my back the whole time. During crunches my back is barely of the floor. No core stability. Down dog in particular was horrendous to look at 😅 Felt like a slap in the face honestly.  

I’ve decided to keep the video (although I want to burn my phone looking at it), focus on form and film another session in a couple of months. 

Wish me luck and tips/resources appreciated 🙏",pilates,2023-08-21 20:22:02

1673551182.0,A beginner's thoughts on how some statements make a lot of them stay away from trying out pilates.,"I have seen a lot of people telling others how ""pilates is not for weightloss"" and most of them are normally teachers or people who have been doing pilates for more than a decade or so. As someone who began on their weightloss journey three years back, I would like to give my perspective as a student, because i feel, often times, fit people forget just how hard it is for beginners especially the ones who are overweight/obese with zero history of physical activity to move around. Feel free to correct me.

1. Losing weight has nothing to do with the activity you are choosing to do. You can do pilates and lose weight continuously while you can gym for 2hours and still gain weight. It all depends on your ""Calories in vs calories out"". If you are working your ass off at a gym but going to Dominos later and hogging on pizza with extra cheese, soda, fries and desserts, even your hard core routine cannot do much to make you lose weight. Yes, pilates won't make you lose weight but neither will weights training if you are not keeping your calorie intake in check. Sentences like ""won't help in weightloss"" simply translates to ""being useless"" in the minds of newbies. Instead of propagating the idea that pilates isn't meant for weightloss, it is more important to educate beginners on how losing fat actually works.

2. Many beginners who turn to pilates to look ""toned"" do not really mean getting shredded and ripped with 6pack abs and high muscle definition. Given how many beginners look at pilates, they are normally looking for exercises that will make them strong with lean muscles.If they wanted the shredded look they wouldn't be venturing into this world but would be in the gyms doing weights training. 

3. Most beginner do not know at the beginning of their journeys what they want to work on. It is by hit and trial, trying out different things that they figure out what works for them and what doesn't. Lines like ""pilates is meant for so and so, not this and this"" ends up confusing a lot of them and eventually causing them to turn to weights training because historically it has been established weightloss=gym. It is important to explain to them things in layman's language. If you work on core strength, you'll probably end up losing weight(depending on your diet) and get a definition in your abs while also building upper body strength and a good stamina. I didn't know all of these because in my head, core strength was useless as it followed the lines ""won't help you lose weight"". Statements with technical terms are only good when talking to an intermediate and advanced person. 

4. It takes a lifetime to build lifestyle. It won't happen in one month. Weightloss is a journey of self discovery. It takes years to find a routine that one person wants to stick to for their entire lifetime and even then it will keep changing with new discoveries. Just because someone starts pilates wanting to look a certain way doesn't mean they are wrong and should be shamed or discouraged, criticized. Instead they should be educated and guided to proper resources so that they can make the most out of any venture they are undertaking.",pilates,2023-01-12 19:19:42

1672442809.0,All I can say is… wow!,"I started Pilates because a friend invited me to a class she regularly attends. I used to weightlift 6x/week for 3 years straight. Although I looked “strong” and had well built up & defined muscles, I was always lacking in flexibility & weightlifting always brought mental and physical stress on myself. When I went to that class, it felt like every move mattered. Squeezing/engaging every muscle on every move. My mind felt quiet and de cluttered during and a few hours after the class. It was very meditative. It also relieved stress while getting a good workout in. I never had that out of breath “I’m going to die I can’t breathe fast enough” experience that I do with weightlifting lol. I always thought that I could never be flexible, but here I am 6 months later and super flexible!! 



I practically never feel stressed anymore, even as a college student. Pilates has well enough maintained my muscles from lifting (they’ve gotten a bit smaller but feel much “tighter”). I lift maybe 1-2x/week now!! I love it. I’m too broke to afford classes so I usually follow Lottie Murphy on YouTube. She’s funny & calming at the same time.

1618864152.0,Focus on Movement instead of muscles,"I’ve been doing Pilates myself since 1989 and teaching it since 1995. So it’s fair to say I am quite experienced.  I’ve seen Pilates grow from a barely known niche to a worldwide phenomenon but I see more misinformation about it the more widely it is spread.  So many people think it’s “for your abs” and the fixation of tightening up the abdominal muscles as a solution to pain or posture is widespread.  

Pilates is a system of movement.  No one muscle is magic and focusing on muscles too much usually brings extra tension. The exercises are movements and if you focus on the body moving and finding healthy movement mechanics the “right” muscles will do their jobs.  Pilates real genius is that these exercises teach the body and mind to work harmoniously as a whole.

If you’re learning Pilates and struggling with back pain and are trying to keep your abdominal muscles tight all the time while exercising I encourage you to switch your focus to breathing and moving gently and fluidly. See how it feels to focus on what your spine is doing in the “ab” work.  Our abdominal muscles move our spine so ab exercises are spine exercises.  Tightening up the abs will tighten up the spine and make movements tight and that isn’t beneficial. Finding fluidity of breath, movement and flowing through the exercises with mental focus and physical efficiency is the goal, not “tight abs”.",pilates,2021-04-19 20:29:12
1678910207.0,muscle and weight gain + pilates - question,"Hi all! 

First of all - disclaimer before Cat Lady Pilates or whatever your name is gets on my ass - I know Pilates is not for weight loss. This is a question about muscle building through pilates. THANKS!

I've been doing reformer pilates consistently (2x a week) since early January. I feel so strong, taller, and leaner. I added in cardio on my off days, so I do an intense incline walk for 30 min about 3 days a week if not 4. I eat very clean with a sweet or boozy treat here and there. I was very surprised when I went to the doctor who said I GAINED weight. 

My doctor said if I am feeling stronger and my clothes feel better, I have lost fat and gained muscle which explains the number. She even said I look more fit. I was under the impression that since pilates is lengthening and low-intensity, that I wouldn't bulk up. Now I realize this might be completely wrong.

I guess my question is - is weight gain (muscle gain) common in pilates practice, like it is with traditional weight lifting? It was my goal to get stronger throughout my body, which I have done on a DEEP level thanks for reformer. However, I am now hoping to trim down a bit so I will keep up the cardio. I'm just confused how muscle gain, toning, and all this works. And how pilates plays into it.

By no means will I stop pilates - I'll do even more since I love it so much - just curious here since my body hasn't changed this much...ever...and I was suprised by the scale.

Appreciate any and all insight!",pilates,2023-03-15 19:56:47
1619116534.0,"Pilates, Flow state & functional fitness","I’m seeing lots of talk about “feeling the burn” and seeing the “hot girl bikini body” challenges and I would like to offer a different perspective on Pilates.   

Pilates is a full mind body practice.  It’s not about targeting your abs or using x amount of weight.  The physical exercises are meant to bring you to the flow state where movement and meditation meet. True well being is about so much more that what you look like. It’s about having a more relaxed body and mind. Enjoying movement with ease. Being able to do the things you love in your life.  Toning up your butt is a secondary benefit... being able to squat down and stand up while doing chores or hiking without pain are far more important. This fixation on being toned and thin isn’t about health. Pilates was not intended to be just physical.  It’s not about doing the exercises perfectly.  It’s a practice and with time it’s effects are going to improve every aspect of your life.  

Don’t be intimidated by the teachers showing off advanced moves in skin tight clothes.   Pilates is much more than that and it’s adaptable for everyone as long as you’ve got a teacher who understands the holistic nature of the work.  Focusing on moving and breathing instead of trying to engage the “right” muscles can make it both more pleasant and more effective.   I’ve seen a teacher here telling someone to make their abs feel like they do when vomiting and I just can’t abide with that terrifying nonsense.  

Please embrace the benefits of moving gently and letting the practice evolve over time. After 31 years of practicing I continue to expand my understanding of this method and the more I relax into the flowing and breathing the better my body and mind feel.  The practice itself is the end result.  And if you want a bikinis body just put the bikini on your body.",pilates,2021-04-22 18:35:34

1673563790.0,Rude Pilates instructor?,"
I had a weird experience with a Pilates instructor today and I’m just wondering if it’s just in my head. 

I’ve been going for about 4 months regularly now. At the one studio I go to, my regular instructor doesn’t focus a ton on form, they kind of teach Pilates in like a lagree style, if that makes sense? It’s made me really strong, but I’ve been testing different Pilates studios and instructors bc I definitely need (and love) to work on form. 

I signed up for a new instructor who recently joined the studio and she is “classically trained compared to the other instructors” (as she kept reminding the class). I LOVED her strict focus on form, would take the class again for her skill level but I was kind of weirded out by some of the things she said. She was also vaping throughout class lol and I was like 🤨 and started class 10 minutes late (which I don’t mind). 

I was really tired and didn’t talk much, but nodded along to her corrections and said thank you (also I was concentrating on the Pilates multitasking while exhausted so I was sweating HAHA) so she turns to the only other person in class and says “I feel like she’s just staring at me? Why is she just doing that and not responding? She probably thinks I’m weird. She has a mask on too, so I can’t see her facial expression. She’s probably judging me.” I was really confused? I respond and say oh, I’m just super tired, my bad didn’t mean to come off like that. And she repeats what she said to the other woman…

When she was instructing me for one move when you had to put one hand over the other hand holding two straps, I accidentally put my hand over the straps. She laughed at me and says “Why would you do that? That’s so weird.” But the other woman who was there (and I believe has been going longer than I have) made the same exact mistake, and the instructor just kindly corrected her, no snarky comment. 

She corrected me a ton (which is exactly what I was looking for) and I swear I didn’t take it personally at all. It just felt like she wasn’t kind about it? Whenever she did fix my stance, it felt like she was laughing at me or making some weird comment. She didn’t give the same energy to the other woman in the class. 

Idk. I’ve taken classes with at least 10 other instructors now and Ive never felt so weird after a class. For context, the instructor and the other person was white and I’m a woman of color. It’s a little disheartening, I’m ngl.",pilates,2023-01-12 22:49:50

1661799159.0,Finally developing a full career as an instructor and it feels really really good.,"A bit of background, I’ve been teaching Yoga since 2014 (college YTT) and Pilates since 2019. In the past, I always taught on top of a full time job and lived on the brink of burnout. I LOVED teaching so I decided to quit my job and just go for it a few months after graduating my Pilates program. That was around October 2019. I was starting to build up my class and client schedule… then Covid. Bummer. I ended up getting a full time work from home job to get by and quit teaching all together. 

A year ago, I dipped my toes back into the teaching world. Things were opening up again, so I thought why not just add some teaching to my plate? My old studio had developed a client waitlist and instructor shortage over Covid, so they enthusiastically brought me back on.  I started with a few classes a week, then took on some clients, then reduced my work hours and took on more classes and clients, did that again, etc. 

Now I’m a full time instructor. I teach about 15 classes a week (divided between yoga and Pilates) have about 5 weekly private clients, am leading Yoga Teacher Training in the winter, and am helping my Pilates studio owner develop her own comprehensive certification course- I have a background in educational program development so it works perfectly!

I’m so happy about it all. I feel like I’m exactly where I want to be and it took so long, but it also happened so fast. It’s a weird feeling. But I’ll take it!

I've been going to the gym since I was 16 (I'm 25 now) and over the years I've really learned to tune in to ""the burn"" if you will. I was lucky enough at one point to be able to afford a personal trainer for a few months when I was younger who really taught me about form and what I should be looking for and sensing while I'm doing an exercise. Through that education, I've been able to explore various equipment-free Pilates workouts on youtube and actually understand what to do and what to feel. 

I used to do a lot of HIIT and heavier weight lifting and I did notice how it affected my body composition. More recently I've started using lighter weights, higher reps, and working on slow and controlled movements. Rather than reaching a rep-count, I use a timer instead. I've noticed more definition and length in my arms doing tiny movements with 1lb weights than I ever have with heavier weights. I've also noticed a huge difference in the look of my core through doing various plank exercises like a plank with a ""hip dip"" or a pike, very slowly, intentionally building up the burn and controlling my muscles and movement.

While I can do this sort of thing at my own gym, I really want to incorporate real pilates classes, with instruction and a reformer, into my fitness routine. The only thing is that I definitely cannot afford to go every single day, or even multiple times a week for that matter. It might be just a once-a-week thing for me for a while.

But I'm just incredibly intrigued by the results I've seen of people doing workouts like MWH that seem so gentle (of course, because I'm viewing them from my background) but the bodies and results you see with these workouts seems GREATER than the ones I've witnessed in gyms of people killing themselves.

Anyone know the science/logic behind it? I've been looking for it but can't find much that justifies my observation so makes me think I'm wrong.

(Maybe something with HIIT increases cortisol and LISS lowers it? Or perhaps the mindfulness aspect makes you more aware of your hunger/fullness cues in a way? etc.)

1692474599.0,The instructor is always asking questions and gets annoyed when the class doesn’t respond.,"During the entire class, she asks questions of the 12 person class and complains when no one responds. Questions are often “How are we feeling?” “Do you feel that in x place?” “Are we having fun?” It’s also random things. Today it was “Is anyone eating lunch after this? Tell me what you’re having for lunch.” If no one responds, she will say that we HAVE to talk to her and she doesn’t like when we don’t respond. She also says if no one talks to her then we don’t get breaks between sets. 

She is the only instructor at my studio that does this and it gives me anxiety. I can’t speak for everyone else but it seems like it makes other people uncomfortable too like we’re in school being called out by the teacher.  I’m trying to focus on my breathing and my body and tune out the world.

1690735983.0,Are pilates supposed to feel this easy?,"So, I have a long history of lower back and hip flexor injury which I'm really trying to fix. I've been told repeatedly that pilates would be good for this so I've been going for about 5 weeks now.

The class I attend feels insanely relaxed. Sure, some exercises definitely do feel like work, but we do a couple of reps on each one slowly and then move on to the next thing. I come out after 45 minutes and barely feel like I've started to ""work out"". And a lot of the exercises are simply balancing or stretching.

Now, I've heard so much good stuff about the benefits of pilates so I'm absolutely willing to give it a prolonged try with reassurance. It could well be that this is just really targeted work that doesn't feel like exercise in the traditional sense. But on the other hand, have I just ended up in a really ""easy"" class? I'm 34M and the majority of other attendees are 50+ and female, so I don't know if it's just a class that's been tailored.

Am I best sticking at it? Am I best working out with core and hip exercises? Or trying a different pilates instructor?

Any advice would be hugely appreciated!

1696235451.0,"After a year and a half of mat pilates, I've finally signed up for a beginner reformer class! Pilates has given me my life back.","I started doing mat pilates in May of last year. I had a health crisis in 2015, a month before I turned 22, which resulted in being diagnosed with undifferentiated connective tissue disease (autoimmune disease, attacked my tendons, small joints, etc.) as well as hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. I'd heard from the get-go that pilates and tai chi were 'safe' for people with EDS, and would occasionally flirt with the idea of trying one or the other, but was often too sick/tired/sore/ugh to seriously try it. 

Well, my autoimmune disease went into remission in January 2022, and after a few months passed, I decided to finally try pilates. I found a couple of 10 minute videos on Youtube specifically for people with EDS. My mind-body connection was awful, and I asked my husband to watch me closely to make sure I wasn't making any major errors for the first couple of weeks. Pilates improved my daily pain levels and joint function almost immediately, even at 'only' 10 minutes, twice a week. And because of that, I just... kept doing it, twice a week, every week, because if I didn't my joint function would nosedive within 10 days. 

I had the opportunity to have a couple of private sessions in October 2022, which was very helpful, but otherwise I've just done it at home with occasional visits to my physical therapist to make sure I'm not doing anything too wrong. I live in rural Norway about 45-60 minutes drive from the next small city, and am homebound without someone (usually my husband) to drive me, so taking private lessons wasn't really feasible.  

Frankly, I hadn't even realized a year and a half had passed. I only really moved from pre-pilates to beginner moves about 6 months ago, and since I've reached that stage I feel like I'm progressing a looot faster. I'm up to doing 30 minutes of pilates + a 20 minute walk three times a week, I'm so! much! more! functional! and I'm only getting stronger. 

We figured out a schedule that works for me to take beginner reformer classes once a week for the next eight weeks, and I'm super excited to finally try it! I love mat pilates, and am curious to see how reformer compares. Pilates has given me my life back just in time for my thirties to start, and I'm so excited to continue improving my health and joint function.",pilates,2023-10-02 08:30:51

I started with one private reformers lesson and went on to a subscription (1x per week group reformer lessons) supplemented by mat with YT videos. I usually do weights, so pilates supplemented by weight training and honestly, it's giving me life. Maybe it's placebo, but I'm far more conscious about my posture (which is why I started) and find myself lengthening my spine whenever I'm slouched and I generally just feel stronger. I'm not as sore as I can get with doing a heavier weight workout, but definitely feel like my muscles have been worked. I also love the clarity I get post-pilates class bc I'm so focused on trying to maintain control through the movements.

I honestly can't believe I had never done this before and just started with turning 30. I really think it's going to be a huge benefit to my health and wish I had started sooner.

1678542038.0,I tried an intro class and I’m hooked but it’s so expensive 😭,"The studio I went to is a popular chain that markets itself as being the accessible/affordable reformer pilates. And I guess relatively speaking, I could see that. But after class when they gave me the prices I almost burst into tears, bc I really loved it and was as sold as I could be,  but $200 a month for 8 classes a month is absolutely not “accessible” for me. I’m a mom of 4 with one in college. 

One of the worst parts is that I realized that in order to do Pilates I do need at least a few months worth of instruction. It’s the first time in my life I’ve accepted that fact—I usually try DIYable (running, weightlifting, etc) fitness, but the instructor corrected my form a couple few times and it made a huge difference. I struggled with some of her cues but once I got it I realized how behind I am. Not to mention I don’t have a reformer.

I know a towel or bands or sliders can modestly fill the reformer void, but I am just so frustrated that something that was originally intended to be accessible is so out of reach for us, that even the “accessible” variations are still very much out of my league. I also do not understand how such a simple piece of equipment costs so much more than a home gym. 

To be fair, I understand that $200 for 8 classes is not entirely unreasonable when you count instructor pay & studio costs, but it still just seems like a fantasy that id ever be able to afford it. I loved it so much I’m considering just becoming an instructor so I can just do Pilates every day.

*ETA:* wow! Thank you all so much for the feedback. So many insightful replies! I was busy at a family function and they piled up, but I’ll be reading through them. I really appreciate the corrections about reformers not being as simple as they seem, and about the costs of running a studio or becoming an instructor. You’re right—$25 per class is really not unreasonable! 

And as for an update about my decision, I’ve decided I’m just going to have to do it. I am a former elementary school resident teacher, and while I don’t want to go back to teaching, I think it would be worth it to substitute teach for a while. My school pays enough that I would only have to work 2-3 days a month to afford a CP membership. I feel so amazing after just one class that I just think it’s worth it.

Hope you all had a great 4th! 

A couple of my friends even asked me recently if Pilates was useful for men (they wanted to get their husbands involved with COVID restrictions being lifted)...

So I was searching for articles to send them on Athletes, specifically male athletes who do Pilates...

And while there were some wonderful resources out there, many of the articles contained athletes who have been retired for many years now.

I know the fitness industry goes through phases, so I wanted to make sure I sent an updated list to my friends. Since I couldn't find an up-to-date resource, I was inspired to create my own!

I ended up creating a post on 25 Male Athletes Who Do Pilates in 2021 (All still active in their respective sport today) as seen below:

[https://pilatesbypamela.com/blog/pro-athletes-pilates/](https://pilatesbypamela.com/blog/pro-athletes-pilates/)

I sent out the article to a few of my friends with the hope that it convinces their husbands to try out at least 1 class lol.

Anyway, I thought I would share this with you all in case you had a friend that needed some additional convincing :). 

I will also make a conscious effort to update the post every 3-6 months to ensure the athletes featured are all still active.",pilates,2021-07-05 15:52:10

1657211929.0,“Toning”,"Pilates marketing makes a lot of promises but I’m sorry to say that like most marketing it’s quite deceptive.  

“Toning” is such a weird claim.  What is that exactly?  It appears to be code for “thin with defined muscles”.   But what about strength?  Pilates will build strength!  It’s a body conditioning method that develops a well balanced and functional body.  

However, what a body looks like is really down to genetics.  Some people can do Pilates regularly and have a healthy diet and include cardio exercise and yet not looked “toned” or have that so called “Pilates body”.  But they’re strong and healthy and functional.  Because that is something Pilates will do for everyone.  

Some people can get a lot of muscle definition.  Some can’t.  Personally I can develop definition in my upper body but not so much in my legs.  Even as a gymnast and professional dancer who did lots of Pilates I never had “dancer” legs because… genetics.  

We can not really control how our bodies look. All those fitness influencers we see look like they do because of genetics.  Or sometimes it’s a combo of over exercising and under eating which is very very unhealthy.  Many women in Hollywood live like that to keep up that look.  And people think looking thin and toned equals healthy but it’s just not true.  Why do you think so many dancers have eating disorders?  Because even with 20 hours of dancing a week not many will have that “dancer” body.  


I wish more people would value being strong, healthy and functional.  Pilates can absolutely do this for everyone.  You can be very strong and healthy and not look “toned”.  And you can look “toned” and be very unhealthy.   Don’t buy into the marketing BS.  Look for what it can do for your quality of life.  Living well and aging well are worth so much more than some mythical “look”.",pilates,2022-07-07 16:38:49

I think i’m quite a rational/logical person, and just found the email really off putting and makes me want to try a different pilates studio instead of that one which is disheartening.

31F. I know working out is so great for you and I have always tried different modalities, but I’ve never really gotten the “energy boost” or “high” that people spoke about with exercise. I’ve been a runner for years and never got it and have been into yoga for years and never really felt it there either. Not even a yin yoga, hot yoga, or sow flow made me feel this way. I always thought that Pilates was like yoga but for people who were less spiritual and body-conscious control freak. 

But I’ve just recovered from a wrist injury so I’ve been starting to build up my workout routine again and so I have just been starting with gentle Pilates to get back into the swing of things. And oh my god I’ve never felt so alive after a workout before. I’m committed (and addicted?) now and will be starting a regular practice now. 

So I just wonder why Pilates works and why it makes me feel so great without being as taxing or “a challenge”. Maybe I’ve been thinking about exercise all wrong. I don’t know. But call me a less-spiritual and body conscious control freak convert!!",pilates,2023-10-20 20:40:57
1686755312.0,"Disabled, not weak or lazy.","Sorry for this rant. I 42 F became disabled with serious RA over the last year, prior to that I was running half marathons and went to the gym regularly. Now the only exercise I’m cleared for is Pilates with modifications and swimming. Finger crossed I’ll be on my home bike soon. 

When I first started Pilates reformer classes I took a couple private lessons to protect myself from further injury, knowing I would need modifications. I can’t do anything on my mid feet, toes or wrists. When I first joined the reformer studio I felt welcomed, but there are a lot of new instructors, and it feels like they are inadvertently putting me down, when I do modifications, like forearm planks on my knees. It feels like they thinks I am lazy or weak. I had one instructor roll her eyes and say yeah just go on your forearms I guess. 

I would give anything to do all these exercises the way they are intended, and this attitude hurts my heart, I left that class in tears, and am avoiding that instructor. 

Pilates is about doing what you can and pushing yourself, which I do. I’m trying to stay strong and avoid surgeries that would push me even further back. I guess I’m trying to reach out to instructors so they know that a disability is not weakness or laziness.  I’m open to advise and feedback. Thank you.

UPDATE: 
So I finally had to reach out to the manager of the pilates studio. I had an issue where I was so ignored that I didn't know what to change my springload too since I couldn't do the jump board.  Oddly enough the initial instructor that made me feel so unwelcome completely changes over the last three weeks, she goes over everything briefly before class and checks in on my all the time. I wonder if she was just stuck on what to substitute. 

I a also taking privates every two weeks and I email her for modifications if I stuck, so I know what to do next time. When I reached out to the studio I told them hey if this is not something your instructors are comfortable with that is okay, but I will need to go somewhere else. I reminded them that showing up is sometimes the biggest battle for anyone in fitness but people with disabilities have additional hurdles in everything. If we are showing up it means we want to be there.

1567352177.0,Detailed thoughts on Blogilates?,"Hello everyone!
As I’ve seen many posts here saying Cassey Ho is a fraud, would someone mind explaining exactly why she is a fraud? I’ve been doing her weekly summer sculpt videos (for two weeks now) which are pretty tough and I’m loving her feedback, and how each video has a day attached to the title (Monday, Tuesday, etc). Even if it’s not strictly Pilates, I find her workout pretty well put together and I like how it’s pretty accessible. 

I didn’t realize people didn’t like her until I found this subreddit. So my question is, why is she a fraud? I don’t want to keep doing these videos if I’m actually hurting myself in the long run (side note: my goal is to lose weight). Please be kind, I’m just starting my fitness/health journey and trying to find videos that are motivational and keep me on track. I’ve looked in this subreddit for this question and didn’t find anything, so my mistake if this has already been asked. 

Thank you for any help/advice you can give!",pilates,2019-09-01 15:36:17

1684208376.0,worst pilates class experience of my life,"*Update: I reached out to the studio manager (or owner, not sure but the one who answers the texts) and they were super nice about the whole situation, and refunded me the entire amount. They said the instructor I had only teaches once a week and that the experience is not the norm. I would be open to trying them again next time. I also understand that as an owner/manager, it can be hit or miss with the instructors that you hire, so I don't want my one experience to discourage others from trying out the studio.*

I live in NYC and this week I'm visiting my family in a suburb outside of Kansas City. I usually workout every day and do reformer pilates at least once a week so I signed up for week-long membership at a local boutique studio.

I had the worst experience ever. There were only 3 people in the class including me, and the other two women were friends with the instructor, so the entire time they just chatted with each other, and every few minutes when there was a lull in their convo the instructor would be like ""ok next move, do this."" It didn't even feel like a class; it felt like I was just working out next to three friends who came to the gym together.

The instructor clearly didn't give a crap about the workout; at one point she literally said ""I don't care"" when another student asked about which movement she should do.

We did a total of 5 different moves in the span of 50 minutes, and it was almost all arms. Sure I got a good arm workout, but the rest of my body feels completely neglected.

I offered to pay for the single class but asked to be refunded the difference. They haven't responded yet.

Has anyone else had an experience like this? This was COMPLETELY unprecedented for me.",pilates,2023-05-16 03:39:36

She moved fast and didn't give much in the way of corrections or extra instruction. Not even many modifications. I just followed along with the woman next to me. And I was sweating, it was tough. I was starting to question if I needed to work out more at home before coming back.

After the class I was the last to get out and a woman was waiting for me outside to let me know that it was actually a super tough class, I did great for a beginner (she must have been lyyyying) and that other instructors give much clearer advice for newbies. She also stressed that pilates has made such a change for her that she didn't want me to be scared off by a bad first experience. It was very sweet.

i understand there’s an obvious benefit to an private lesson on a reformer but is it illegal for a gym to offer free use of a reformer as a part of the regular machines??

Pilates is a complex system with hundreds of different exercises!  It’s also a philosophy of fitness based on principles like breath, precision, control, etc.  it’s not supposed to be easy or be learned in a couple of weeks or months.  It’s a practice that was created to be something you do for life. Consistent practice is the only real key.  Nothing is learned instantly and nothing yields instant results.  It takes a long time to build strength and flexibility and change your body.  And Pilates is also about your mind. Connecting with your body and mind are much more important than getting toned abs or triceps.  

Don’t compare yourself to others. Just keep practicing. Try to enjoy learning and moving. There’s no rush. I’ve been doing Pilates for more than half my lifetime and I’m still learning and growing with it.  It’s meant to be a practice. There’s no recital!",pilates,2022-02-16 21:29:47

Most comprehensive teacher training programs do not talk about working with people in larger bodies which is a shame because they spend time talking about working with seniors and pregnant people as well as how to train people with specific injuries. Because of this, the concept of weight limits on equipment has mostly been overlooked and many Pilates instructors are unaware weight capacities even exist on their equipment.

Observe how they describe the exercises, give cues and modifications.   “Perfect” abs don’t help you be a good teacher.  True Pilates teachers are focused on the work, not selling themselves as a brand and showing off their body. 

Anula Maiberg is a wonderful example of an incredible teacher who does not fit the typical image of what a Pilates teacher looks like.   And I am now 50 and post menopausal and my body doesn’t look it’s best anymore but with 27 years of experience teaching Pilates my skills as a teacher are way better now then when I was younger and in “better shape “.   


If you want to learn Pilates look for actual Pilates teachers!   Not influencers or models!   Pilates Anytime is a great resource, each teacher is certified and well vetted, unlike many of the YouTube “stars”.",pilates,2023-01-25 20:14:18
1654731099.0,"""Nutrition labels"" for YouTube pilates channels","I just released a new version of my (free) app that improves YouTube workouts.  It has a lot of the most recommended channels from this sub pre-loaded (but lets you load \*any\* channel). 

So like Move with Nicole, obviously, Robin Long, Lottie Murphy, Moving Mango, Isa Welly, Trifecta, Lesley Long, Flow with Mira, Jessica Valant, etc.

One of the things I was noticing is that its hard for new people to get into Pilates online because there are \*so\* many choices. So I added what I think of as ""nutrition labels"" for the channels. 

No sense in starting with Move with Nicole (for example) if your goal is to start with 10 minute workouts, because 60% of her workouts are in the 30-45 minute range. On the other hand, Robin Long is \*strongly\* weighted to 5-10 minute videos with almost nothing longer, so if you're looking for a 30 or 60 minute class experience, she wouldn't be the best choice. Both are obviously strong choices with hundreds of thousands of followers and millions of views.

The app automatically generates these labels for any channel, but you can see some samples below.

1633494925.0,Club Pilates success story so far,"So I’ve been a member at CP since June and started working there a few weeks ago part time, I’m 35 classes in…let’s say I’m pretty addicted. I’d love to take more classes but I get called in last minute to work. So I go 3 times a week (even though I wish I could go 4-5 times a week). 

I feel like I’ve gotten a lot stronger and more toned. I used to be a Pure Barre member. I have seen posts in other subs comparing PB and CP and people saying that PB is much harder, more challenging, gets better results, CP is too easy…for me I feel like when I did PB, I compromised on my form a lot because the moves were so fast paced and frantic, and I wasn’t feeling like I was getting stronger. For example, PB does a 90 second plank. Even when I was 200+ classes in I still couldn’t get through the plank without dropping down on my knees. I think a lot of it was because we did some weird moves along with the plank and I couldn’t catch up.

I take a level 1 class every Tuesday because omg the instructor is so hard, her classes are harder than some of the level 1.5 classes I’ve taken. I know taking her classes will whip me into shape. She has us do a 1 minute plank but because I’ve been going more, and because she actually cues on how to get the correct form, and because the planks are simpler (we can go side to side though), I can hold it all the way. 

My arms are also getting a lot stronger with the straps on the reformer.

Just thought I’d share. I wish I could go everyday! I would love to keep on going until I can get to a level 2 class. This is a workout I can see myself doing forever.",pilates,2021-10-06 04:35:25
1619185069.0,Pilates and chronic pain,"A personal note on Pilates and pain…

If you struggle with chronic fatigue, chronic pain, autoimmune issues, flare-ups, low energy or any other ailment that impacts how you feel in your body day to day, I see you and I hear you.

My first few years of Pilates were not about getting ripped or getting a good sweat in. Honestly, they still aren’t! I don’t talk about this often on social media, but thanks to a genetic disorder (EDSh) I spend time moving my body to keep my shoulder from dislocating, to keep my knee in place and to ease my back pain. My Pilates foundation has been an amazing arsenal of tools for me to care for my body that I”m so grateful I have access to. But even with the best toolbox, there are going to be crappy days.

A few things I’ve learned on my Pilates and wellness journey...
1.Ask yourself what your body needs, and what resources you have to care for yourself. You may feel like you need to move for an hour but have limited energy levels today. Or the reverse. Take needs and resources into account and try to balance those.

2.Get outside. If you do nothing else today, take a step outside. I know that can feel like a-lot on more intense days. Even if its for 1 minute, drag yourself to the door and get a few breaths of fresh air.

3.Let go of expectations that no longer serve you. I’ve always wanted a 6 pack. That’s just not what I’m energetically available to pursue right now. I let that shit go. If I’m going to spend time moving it’s to take care of my body, not to make it look a certain way. 

4.Ask for help. As much as you can, use your support systems around you!

5.Compassionately ignore well-meaning but hurtful comments. You know the ones I’m talking about.

6. Play around with playful bursts of movement. Maybe you aren’t up for an hour workout, totally fine. Are you up for 5 minutes of mobility or breath work on the mat?",pilates,2021-04-23 13:37:49
1604155666.0,Is anyone getting great tone and physique through Pilates alone?,"I just got done with my first session and I walked away fascinated. I ended up buying more sessions. Pilates feels like we're solving problems using precise movements vs aggressively tackling problems with as much resistance as we can handle. At first I didn't feel like we did anything but then when I left the building I realized my body had done more than I thought.

1692547415.0,How teaching has made me a better person,"When I first started my journey to become a Pilates teacher I was 19, super thin, and I had crippling anxiety around people. I avoided big groups of people and missed out on a lot of fun get togethers with friends or family. I would get panic attacks whenever I did simple things like going to the grocery store. 

Now that I’m 23 and have been teaching for 2 years, I’m strong and look forward to going out. Teaching has really helped me overcome my anxiety with people. Doing Pilates alone has helped me overcome my eating disorder because now I think of food as a way to get stronger rather than it being the enemy. I came to the conclusion that if I don’t eat I won’t be able to properly demonstrate exercises. If I don’t take care of myself I can’t take care of other people. 

I’m constantly looking for ways to improve myself and my career in a healthy way. I’m so grateful that I discovered this method. Pilates has changed my life and has made me a better person.",pilates,2023-08-20 16:03:35

I did a reformer class at Club Pilates while I was in a big city visiting and fell in love. I live in a smaller town and found an instructor (she’s a master instructor, 25 years of experience) that teaches mat pilates and reformer. Her rates are 36 dollars per reformer class and 12 dollars per mat class. Is that a good deal? I think her reformer classes have 3 other people in them. Just curious because that seems like a lot to me per class for reformer compared to Club Pilates.",pilates,2023-08-16 20:26:41

Two big things that have been noticeable this week: I carried a 50lb. suitcase up 20 stairs with no problem. Before pilates, it would have been borderline impossible. Second thing: my right calf has been cramped and a bit painful to walk on. Today when we did footwork where the heels drop below the foot bar, it worked it right out as I had a feeling it would.

Working 6 days a week and going to college is honestly exhausting. However, when a client tells me I’ve made their pain go away, it just brings that spark back.

1653313970.0,"For gym-goers who incorporated pilates into their routine, how often do you do each activity?","I'm a pretty avid gym-goer myself, I usually go 6 days a week and mix up what I work on. I work with a personal trainer once a week who monitors my progress and helps me build out my routine - for the rest of the week I cycle upper and lower body accordingly, with a cardio or core-focused day here and there to break things up. I've always loved the gym but I've been really committed for the past 7 or so months and have gone from thin to strong.

I had tried a few pilates classes in the past but wound up investing my money in the gym and a trainer. However, I was traveling abroad last month and wound up doing reformer pilates exclusively as my only ""workout"", pretty much daily.... and I loved it. I saw a change in my body quite quickly. I was already at a perfect weight and body fat percentage but I just saw myself lean down in general. I also felt great, limber and balanced, whereas I'd sometimes feel ""creaky"" after a week of lifting.

When I came home and saw my trainer again he was eager to test whether or not pilates maintained my fitness or depleted it over that month. To his surprise, my core was exceptionally stronger (it was already strong to begin with) and my overall strength had stayed more or less the same. The biggest difference that I noticed was how it actually felt to lift weights, I had absolutely no pain with deadlifting, which I was experiencing prior, and all of my movements felt smooth and controlled. 

I love the results that I've achieved so far and I want to incorporate reformer classes into my regular weekly routine. One thing that I'm particularly interested in aside from the functional benefits is the prospect of leaning down a little. I love the gym, my trainer, and my routine but I've noticed myself getting a little bulkier than I'd like. I know that I won't get super bulky since I'm a woman but I'd still just like to be a little leaner. I think that the puffiness can also be related to the stress that lifting and harder workouts put on the body as well... whereas I usually feel leaner and less bloated after pilates.

So I've done a 100% gym-based routine for a while, and I did a 100% pilates-based routine for a month, what will happen when I put them together? How often should I do one or the other to see the results that I want while still maintaining strength?

Ultimately I want to keep all of the muscle and strength that I've managed to build but just lengthen and lean my body out a little, while also getting the functional benefits of movement in both the gym and daily life.

For anyone else who does both, what have you found to be the best split?",pilates,2022-05-23 13:52:50

I've taken a pilates class here and there at ymcas and other gyms throughout my life before, but have never really stuck with it. I am a classically trained ballet dancer and I have a solid grasp on alignment from having taken anatomy courses throughout my career in movement modalities. I was looking to add some injury prevention to my routine, which led me to pilates - CP wouldn't be my first choice but its geographically convenient and everything I've read complaining about CP is mostly about instructors not cuing good form and I figured I'd be safe since I know what I'm doing when it comes to alignment. Today, I took a class with a different instructor (had my first two with the same person + now this one with someone else - intro, foundations and flow 1) and afterwards wondered just how qualified they are.....wellllll CP doesn't post bios online!!!!

1530929492.0,3 months in,"Its officially been three months since I started practicing Pilates and I can 100% say it has changed my life. I have had pretty severe scoliosis (two curves, primary being thoracic) and I have suffered from back pain for a long time.

Last year I was lying on my couch doing absolutely nothing and my SI joint just seized. I couldn't move, I had to take a cortisol injection, 6 months later same thing. I'm 26 and in shape, so this shouldn't be happening. My doctor suggested I try Pilates, I was hesitant at first but I had tried everything else (including PT) so I figured what the hell.

My first session was a one-on-one in a Pilates studio. I liked the session, but I didn't come back for almost two months. When I did I took a Mat class and thats when it clicked for me. I have been going three times a week to Mat classes for 90 days now and I haven't felt ANY pain. Not only that but I have a completely new body, my legs are MUCH stronger, I can stand/walk/run for way longer without getting tired, my posture is better, my flat feet (thanks scoliosis) have been getting better, you get the picture. Not only that, but its been so good for my mental health too 

I'm afraid I've become somewhat obsessed, I keep telling people to sit up straight 😂

Anyway, a few weeks ago I started doing one-on-one's with my studio's apprentice (I would ask if this is a thing at your studio, its a great deal!) and now the exercises make a lot more sense and I actually enjoy using the equipment

To compensate, they pretty much recreate a club environment: dimmed lights, flashing colourful neon lights and loud techno music. You can’t hear your own breathing and I struggled to hear the instructor even though he had a microphone. To make matters worse, the instructor paid zero attention to form, not even with new students! He just kept walking from one end to the studio to the other, but looking at the floor/walls rather than the students. He didn’t even bother correcting a single person (class of 10-12). He didn’t even help me reach out for my straps after I dropped them once, even though he was standing right next to me. The transitions were also happening immediately so not even time to adjust springs and straps for the next exercise. 

To each their own when it comes to environments and I prefer natural lighting, more neutral music and a focus on form. I’m not a Pilates purist by any means and in fact prefer intense dynamic Pilates (which this was), but this class was totally awful.",pilates,2023-09-29 11:41:31

1681529236.0,Flexia Real Review,"I purchased a Flexia reformer bundle around Black Friday last November. I thought it would share my honest review and feedback for anyone looking for Flexia information because I’ve seen a few posts asking about the reformer (and it was information I was looking for last year). 

First of all, the machine is absolutely beautiful and you can tell it is made with high quality materials. The customer service team has been awesome to work with as well. It glides so smoothly and quietly. The size inclusivity thoughtfulness by the company was a great idea. It comes with a sitting box, jump board, and standing platform that are all extremely well-made. It was very easy and quick for one person to install and set up. 

However, I unfortunately had several interactions with the customer service team because one side of my footbar would never lock into place tightly and safely. I sent photos/videos to the team and they sent me a new footbar that had the exact same problem. I really wanted to make it work because I was loving everything else about the machine at that point. So I asked them to send me a new corner piece that the footbar slides into, because it seemed like that piece was the problem. Unfortunately, after taking it apart and putting it back together with the new corner, the problem was somehow WORSE than before. Now the footbar really wouldn’t lock into place at all. After that I initiated a return because I was within my 60 day trial period (I think they recently changed this to 30 days).

Also, while I admitted earlier that I was initially happy to support a company that was size inclusive, I wound up not personally enjoying the huge size of this reformer. I’m a medium-sized, medium-height woman, and the size of the carriage completely swallowed me. I had a difficult time finding myself (aligning) on the machine. On other reformers, I could use the sides and end of the carriage to feel out where I was aligned, and this carriage was way too big. While I still am glad there is a company catering to more bodies doing pilates, I can’t recommend medium or smaller sized bodies to use this machine. 

The sensors seem pointless. I tried the online platform, and there are only about 20 videos right now the correlate to the sensors. Also, they don’t really give you any detailed information, it’s just weird graphs with no explanations. And about half the time my sensors would not even connect. This might be the most useless aspect of the machine. 

Overall, I think Flexia is a very legitimate company that is trying to use quality materials to make a solid, mid-price-range reformer. Customer service and the team members were honestly incredible to work with and so helpful. The refund processed very quickly too! I think they just need some engineering tweaks in order to be reliable (footbar should just be a more typical folding style)! And the technology is years away from being actually helpful. 

I live in a smaller city, and so the used reformer market is severely lacking. However, I finally found a used balanced body studio reformer for a great price on Facebook marketplace and am so incredibly happy now!! I could not have afforded a brand new one of these with all the accessories, so I really lucked out with this. I wish the Flexia had worked out, as it was a beautiful piece of equipment, but after about a years worth of searching and trial and error, I’m a Balanced Body lifer now.",pilates,2023-04-15 03:27:16

1664393114.0,Concerned about continuing with solidcore?,"So, it seems like the general consensus here is that Solidcore us unsafe, but I’m having trouble deciding what to do next. 

I’ve flirted with exercise on and off. I lost some weight (and gained it) before the pandemic and got into on yoga, walking, mobility and was starting making progress on body weight and dumbbell lifts. Also completed C25k at one point but my shins really started bothering me so I stopped running.

Now, I’m in a place where I can afford more exercise classes. I wanted to work on strengthening my core and helping my mobility so I can get back into running. I’m still very heavy and would like to lose some weight to reduce impact on my joints. 

I signed up for two weeks unlimited at solidcore thinking it would be like yoga - NOPE. It was like the hardest HIIT class I had ever taken.

My main concern is safety. I feel like the coaches didn’t do great modifications and I had trouble understanding the instructions. I don’t want to injure myself and cause more issues with trying to rehab. I also have almost lost balance a few times, despite using handholds and the stability bar. The machines are packed so tightly together and the floor is concrete. I feel like I could seriously hurt myself or someone else. We also aren’t getting any breath instruction which I thought was a pretty core component of Pilates. However, since I finished my third workout today, I’m starting to feel really good and love the focus on abs and hamstrings. 

My other options are a new Club Pilates that opened up, a larger megaformer/versaclimber studio,  yoga/Pilates studio that has springboard Pilates classes (and private, expensive reformer lessons that are a bit above my budget), and a semiprivate studio that is further then I’d like to travel (20 min driving) for a morning workout - I have to be in the office, no WFH. What should I look into next? Should I just spend the money to go private?

1693661361.0,Cueing low-level abdominal engagement,"I'm reading this beautiful new book by Tracy Ward, Science of Pilates. (It looks amazing, seriously.)

In the introduction there's a section on maximum vs. low abdominal contraction (in the context of the evolution of pilates). ""Belly button to spine, which activates the global abdominal muscles with maximal exertion and effort, was previously the cue for abdominal activation. This can cause overactivity and early fatigue, whereas the low-level engagement isolates the transversus abdominis first and allows for stabilization of the spine and control.""

How would you cue this low-level engagement? I haven't seen any alternatives in the book so far, at least not in this section in the introduction.

I'm a pilates instructor student, not certified yet. I've learned so far that the 'navel to spine' cue is not considered the best cue for another reason. I have learned that this cue is not optimal when the objective is to create intra-abdominal pressure and activate muscles all around the trunk incl. multifidi. The back muscles might be left unattended, not activated with the 'navel to spine' cue which focuses on the front side. So yeah would love to hear about any good cues to replace 'navel to spine'. Both for low-level activation (this piece of knowledge was new to me) and for IAP.

As an aside, as a class participant in pilates and other types of classes, long before starting my pilates education, I could never understand this cue. When I follow it, it seems like my stomach sinks in without any muscles being active. It's probably not the case because something must work to sink it in, but what I get is this scooped out stomach and the feeling of elongated spine, it's like a stretch, and that is very different from activation that I get from e.g. bracing.

1691480761.0,Why is pilates so expensive?,"Studio memebership is generally $50-70 per week.

And they might offer 20-30 classes / week.

So it's staffed for low hours, and the instructors are paid on a casual basis. 
A medium sized club might have 150 people signed up. 

So 400-500k revenue from memberships.
100k in paying instructors, assuming they get 60/hr, or per class.
Then 50k in lease of studio space?

Looking at 250-300k in profit, let's round down to 200k..


******

I get the impression owners are swimming in cash and as consumers we just accept it??

Restaurants and Cafes struggle, they barely break even. And that's because food is competitive and we vouch for the best quality and cheapest price.
Why aren't pilate studios also given the same treatment?


Edit:

Per year basis, 52 weeks

(Weekly fee*total members*weeks in year)
70*150*52 = ~500k revenue

(Instructor pay*classes/week*weeks in year)
60*30*52 = ~100k 

50k is a lease guestimate 

Then, misc costs for electricity, facebook advertising.

I understand that it's impossible to please everyone, but I can't help feeling deeply affected by this feedback.

I have spoken to my boss about whether i can take on fewer classes, but she reminded me that I had expressed a desire for a full-time workload during my interview. However, at the time, I did not realize how mentally exhausting teaching can be. My boss assured me that the first three months would be the most stressful, and that it will get easier after that.

Despite her reassurance, I am unsure about the sustainability of this career given my current state of mind. I had hoped to pursue this career for a long time, but I am now uncertain if I can.

I would appreciate any advice from more experienced instructors on what motivates them to keep going. I love pilates, but I feel myself burning out, even though I've only just started.",pilates,2023-03-28 08:36:48

It feels like the perfect blend of stretching and gentle strength training. (I’m in my 50’s so my body can’t take too hard core of an exercise routine.)

I’ve really struggled to increase my activity and fitness but because I must sign up for classes on an app I can’t just be lazy and not go. 

I initially signed up for 4 classes a month just to try it out, and today I signed up for unlimited classes. (Only $30 more than 8 classes a month so I thought it was worth it). 

My question is how much is too much? Should I just go wild and sign up for daily classes, or should I hold off and sign up for 3 a week? 2 a week? Any advice welcome.",pilates,2023-03-07 20:16:35

Sore for a few days and just end up not doing any movement in between bc of that. I also think I’ve been finding the gym monotonous.  

also have been feeling horrible in my body lately- like as if I have muscle imbalances, poor mobility, tight shoulders from working so much…I also love to do yoga(I’m at a high intermediate stage but have been less consistent bc of school) but I don’t really feel good doing it lately bc of how poor my mobility has gotten and how cold my muscles feel. 

My goals right now are to gain more functionality in my body which seems like I will get that from Pilates- and I also love the idea of being in a class with other people. but I also really really want to put on muscle that you would get from the gym.

Things were ramping up nicely for a single person business and I was reaching a point where I could work my real job less and increase studio hours for a really nice work/ life balance.  And then, the covid.

Like all other small studios and instructors, I've moved to an online platform.  It's been a struggle, honestly.  There's so much energy and enjoyment in working with someone in person that is very hard to replicate online.  I have enjoyed the online and wouldn't mind working with about half of my clients that way, just not 100%.

Anyway, in doing the online work, I've found that I really enjoy sharing the little interesting things I know about Pilates, stretch, anatomy and exercise in general as well as answering questions that tend to get skipped over in a class because things are moving to quickly or folks feel insecure in asking for more help or clarification or they don't even know they have a question.  

For fun, I've been making a few videos here and there with answers to questions people ask during classes.

1680417090.0,Pilates in Australia," 

As a *student*, I’m really disappointed with the style of pilates that is becoming more and more evident in my part of Australia (Victoria) at the moment. 

I have been in a lot of ""pilates"" classes that really look like ""fitness style classes"" that just so happen to be on a moving platform with springs thrown in.  

* Little, to no attention to alignment or control, exercising to fatigue, getting caught up in a room of participants who are moving too quickly.
* Lack of continuity, in revisiting exercises and repertoire, resulting in making it difficult as a student to ever really get good at an exercise and feel that you are making progress over time.
* Using slogans like ""movement is medicine"" which enables the camouflaging of lack of attention to detail and form, resulting in an anything will do approach.
* Using phrases such “as evidence based practice"" or ""scientifically proven"" to erode away at traditional repertoire and allow for a random non flowing lesson of random hybridised movements that are being incorporated just to “mix things up a bit.”",pilates,2023-04-02 06:31:30

I’ve also walked by studios in passing often in my neighborhood and never seen a man in/around a class before. 

I guess I don’t know what norms are around this, and I don’t want to make women uncomfortable by showing up to a space they feel like they expect to be filled with women.

1647661530.0,Soreness,"People have asked about being sore after beginning  Pilates.   Yes, it’s normal to have some soreness.  However being so sore that you can barely walk and can’t go to your next class a couple days later is just too much.  Pilates takes time to learn. Strength takes time to build. Getting a workout that’s so intense that you’re in a lot of pain and can hardly move isn’t good.  It’s unfortunately common, too many teachers don’t take it into consideration that someone who’s really a beginner and hasn’t exercised in years or decades needs to start slowly.  When things feel like too much you can let yourself ease up, take a break for a moment, skip something that feels to intense.  It takes time to build up to a full fast paced class. Don’t be afraid to tell your teacher that you need to take it easy because you’re wanting to build your strength up slowly.  No one gets stronger from one killer class, it’s doing the work consistently for months, years.  Let yourself go at a pace that feels safely challenging, not desperately overwhelming!",pilates,2022-03-19 03:45:30

1614731822.0,How often should you do Pilates?,"As a studio owner/instructor I get this question a lot! I thought I’d share some common answers in case anyone else has been wondering the same thing!

How often should I be doing Pilates? Great question! 

How often do you want to be doing Pilates? It's that simple! The best schedule is one that you genuinely love, look forward to, want to make time for, and is sustainable. That looks different person to person, and even season to season.

Some questions I like to ask anyone looking to build their ideal Pilates schedule...
Do you do alot of other activities or is Pilates your main form of movement?
Do you feel refreshed after Pilates or like you need to take a few days to recover?
How much time per week do you think will help you fulfill your Pilates goals or other movement goals in general? 
Are you brand new to Pilates?

Maintain your practice-1x a week
In general, if you are doing other amazing things with your body, have goals of cross training or keeping up your Pilates practice, 1-2x a week is usually awesome.

Improve your practice-2x a week
If you have really specific goals you are working towards that you feel require more dedication, or you want to use Pilates to move more often, I recommend starting at 2x a week.

Start Pilates for the first time-2-3x/week for 1 month Are you brand new to Pilates? Welcome!!! I have so many exciting things to say if you are brand new, but I'll try to keep it short. The best thing you can do is invest in building a Pilates foundation. That doesn't necessarily mean 3x a week private sessions for the rest of your life! What I have seen work most effectively is 2-3x a week, or at least 6 sessions, your first month. It's just enough to start knowing what to feel and when, get used to new ways of moving, and usually is right about when I see clients starting to feel a lot more confident. From there I suggest evaluating scheduling needs/goals again. Sometimes we lower to 1-2x a week, sometimes we add in groups, sometimes we keep the schedule you already love. That's what I've seen work well, but what works best is what you love!",pilates,2021-03-03 00:37:02

I heard so many people talk about this style that I decided to try it out! As a yoga instructor, martial arts black belt, boxer, pilates mat instructor (getting comprehensively certified as we speak) I was like I will try any workout class once! 

BIG mistake. I will say, horrible instructors exist in every space but this class I just took made me want to grab the bungee rope and put it around my neck (kidding but not really) LOL.
The instructor quite literally said no modifications, and when someone told her they had a back injury all she did was tell them to keep it pushing. Being used to the slow flow of different types of yoga & Pilates, I thought it was going to be a heavier load but it went by FAST. No correction of form. At all! 

Given that Sebastian lagree is suing places that claim they’re lagree, this isn’t that either.  


I even wished Joseph Pilates would come back to life to sue everybody that uses the name Pilates in their workout disregarding injuries, checking form, and disrespecting the space.

Like it or not Reformer Pilates is still a very much female focused form of exercise (edit: not “female focused”, more “female frequented”). However I have noticed that any time someone brings their male partner or friend to the studio more likely than not it is a revelation to them. Often the men start coming by themselves and I have now had a number of classes with majority male participants. 

Men stand to benefit greatly from using the reformer as it adds the much needed flexibility to their routine as well as taking care of their core and strength needs.

I have noticed that even during home visits for female clients with reformers men always use it for stretching and some basic moves. Maybe not for the full hour but definitely to go through mini routines.

I encourage you to bring your male friends/partners to your favourite studio as not only is it of great benefit to them but will also help spread the awareness of Reformer Pilates amongst the less fairer sex.

1693864837.0,Is it safe to do pilates if I'm overweight? To put that much pressure on my joints,"Hello, I am currently on a weight loss journey, I've already lost 18 lbs. from my highest weight. I ride an exercise bike 30 minutes a day and walk at least an hour everyday with my dog, sometimes longer, especially if I'm listening to a good audio book. I try to watch what I eat as well. But I have thought of trying Pilates. But when I do a workout, I see that there is an emphasis on body weight, but I am worried that with me being overweight that I might be putting too much pressure on my joints, and maybe I should wait until I'm at a lighter weight to do Pilates safely.

But can you do Pilates safely at a heavier weight? Or is it too much pressure on my joints? Or is it something I can do now? I really do want to do pilates, but I worry about injuring myself. So, some advice is needed

This is EXTREMELY embarrassing to admit, but I have a BMI of 37.5, but I felt I had to say this for you to be the better judge.

EDIT: I should note I don't have money for a pilates instructor. I only have access through videos on websites like youtube",pilates,2023-09-04 22:00:37
1686647184.0,Are Private Pilate lessons worth it (for fixing lower back pain and weak core)?,"I’m in my early-20s and am incredibly inflexible. I have always exercised by running (recently could finish a half-marathon) but never on flexibility/core, resulting in strong quads but weak core, glutes and the worse thing… frequent lower back pain.

I get lower back pain after light lifting, stretching and even running. I cannot do a pull-up or even a push-up. I’ve been to several mass yoga/pilates sessions but it’s rarely helped; the instructors barely adjust my positions and don’t explain anything, and my wrists end up hurting too! 

I found a private reformers Pilates instructor who offers 3 lessons for $500 in her private studio - is this worth to strengthen my core, correct my posture and fix my pain?

1677803817.0,Rant on Club Pilates !,"I have went to Club Pilates New Albany for several months. I will never go back or recommend anyone to this facility. Here is why.

Poor customer service & billing

February, I was on an 8 ($199) class package. I asked to downgrade in March to the 4 ($104) package. I already had 4 classes roll over into March (these are my February classes and I asked in February for the rollover). I needed to stop all together in March (family health issues).

I was told by the OWNER. I would still have to be billed because it’s 30 days notice. So I’m cool with that. I understand.

I clearly explained that I had 4 credits roll over from February and downgraded. So I should only have pay for 4 ($104) classes. So my total of classes in March will be 8.

HOWEVER,

When I see my credit card. I am charged 8 ($199) in March. I called to notify Club Pilates New Albany that I had a billing issue.

The representative read my notes and looked up my account. She proceeded to tell me that, “since I downgraded my membership and THEN cancelled, my downgrade was revoked and I would pay the $199 instead of $104”.

I commented saying “this is not what I was told, I was told that I would have a total of 8 classes and be downgraded for March. I don’t mind paying the $104”

Club Pilates New Albany representative said, “the owner wrote a note saying, she explained that your cancellation removes your downgrade. So I have to pay $199”.

Overall, This is not true. This is a lie. This was my first time hearing about this downgrade and cancellation situation.

If Club Pilates New Albany would have contacted me to explain the cancellation overrode my downgrade. I would have understood and wouldn’t be here writing in dissatisfaction.

But that is not what happened. I felt completely pushed to the side because I canceled my membership. This was an easy $199 to get before I left the studio.

I’m disappointed. It’s not about the money. It is about the principle and poor customer service. I was planning on coming back in the fall. However, I won’t be coming back here or referring other people.

I have told family and friends about Club Pilates New Albany. The instructors are amazing! However, the owner, how they deal with billing issues, and communication is embarrassing to the franchise.

PS. I was planning on taking the 4 rollover classes from February in March. I wasn’t even going to use the 4 classes due to the 30 day cancellation policy (I was planning on asking to donate them, I don’t need them).

Since this negative encounter, I reuse to step foot in this studio. I will not support a business that works in such a foul manner.

Keep the cash. I can go elsewhere.





UPDATE: 3/3/23

Yall are so awesome!! I took the advice to dispute & receive an email confirmation that I canceled my membership. 

I ended up receiving a call from the Regional Director. She apologized for the situation and gave me a full refund. She said that I was not told the policy, and it’s their fault for not communicating. 

Overall, the rectification was positive. I would still give customer service a B for this franchise. Because it’s not easy to call and admit wrongdoing. So I do appreciate their willingness to make amends. 

Ps. I still got documentation of me canceling and the refund (momma ain’t raise no fool)





UPDATE: 3/15/23

Y’all are right! CP sucks!!!

I got a text from the regional. Saying 

“Hi! This is Ellen @ Club Pilates :) You should see the $199 march payment was cleared from your card. It was refunded on our end. So, you 
shouldn't…see that $199 payment at all on your card anymore. Your bank reversed it as a ""chargeback"" which means they never even let it clear on their end :) Thanks!”

I responded 

“Hi Ellen, I'm on the phone with capital one and they don't have a credit….

Hey sorry for the blunt comment. I was on the phone with Capital One. They said if I received a credit. It would show in my transactions. It wouldn't net out.

Above is my last transaction from Club Pilates. 

Hi Ellen, were you able to research on your end the issue?”

I followed up with 3 text messages…

1623290658.0,Yogini who added Pilates...,"Hi all - I just wanted to share my journey with Pilates with you because I'm so thrilled with how I feel.   I've been a group fitness instructor for about 12 years, and I'm in my early 40s now.    I taught Les Mills programs and did Yoga teacher training in 2013.     Back in 2015-16, I was taking weekly semi-private Reformer classes as a ""thing"" I did for myself and I loved it.   Career changes forced me to give up most of my teaching and weekly Pilates, but I kept teaching weekend yoga classes.    I dabbled in Crossfit in 2019 for about 6 months, but it wasn't for me.    Pandemic hit, and I taught online classes (mainly to keep my class community together - I teach at a gym, not a studio).    When the world started to open again, I wanted to do something for myself that was not yoga.   I researched and found that I had several highly-rated Club Pilates locations near me.   I did the Intro class and fell in love with this discipline all over again.   I've been a member since mid-March and will complete my 55th class tomorrow!   I feel strong, balanced, and lifted!   Best decision I made this past year for sure.   I know CP can vary in quality but I am fortunate to have excellent quality instructors at my studios.",pilates,2021-06-10 02:04:18

I thought you guys might like to see these to be able to implement, experiment, or just enjoy!","Hi, guys. I was a dancer for 9 years and was going through Pilates certification through my college with a dance focus before I had to stop due to health and finances. My advanced Pilates class was taught using the traditional/classical methodology. Every Pilates course I had required weekly journals. We had all Pilates apparatuses and I know I have some exercises from the wundachair and reformer(which I labeled). I also know that we had a magic circle class and a foam roller class. These journals included:

1. An exercise learned.
 
2. How to perform the exercise (with breathing usually included in my write up).

3. Cues used - especially ones that I found helpful. 

4. Modifications 

5. My experience with the exercise itself. I’m keeping this part because you can maybe take my experiences and background into thinking about clients who may be similar. 

I also found an outline of new exercises learned during different weeks in the Advanced class (both mat and reformer). I also have a the prompt (I’m gonna look to see if I have the write up) from a Pilates methodology class where the final gave us a client (usually with specific ailments - mine was a senior woman with somethings) and we had to name different exercises with modifications on different apparatuses and such. Might be cool to look at.

Fellow fat people, what have been your experiences using the reformer? Also, have you had positive experiences with instructors?

1544395812.0,I'm in love with Pilates,"I started doing Pilates last week after random colleagues over the years saying they do it, and I've found that I love it! I'm finding that I'm actually looking at my calendar, noticing I have nothing booked, and then seeing if there's a class I can go to.

Over the years I've enjoyed many other forms of exercise. Cycling, walking, gym, hiking. But none of them seem to be lasting. They're great while I'm doing it, but then the motivation to return is gone. Going through the motions of exercising, then relapsing into old habits, then exercising, and relapsing. Maybe I valued junk food over progress, or the weather determine what I could do.

This is the first time I've actually wanted to exercise regularly. I can see that this will be in my life forever, whatever weight or fat % I'm at.

The first class I did was Mat Pilates, and it was HARD. I couldn't do any of the movements involving my core (stomach, chest, abs etc). But the instructor didn't push me like I'd push myself, or a personal trainer would. There was no guilt involved, just do what you can. This is an exercise for life, there's no quick fixes and it can take years to master and even then there's still more to learn.

The second class I did was Reformer, and this is where I've found my passion. I did 3 reformer classes last week, and this week I've booked in 5 classes + a Yoga 101 class.

I want to get back into those mat classes!

Now that I've found what works for me, I'm happy to pay for a membership. The cost is an investment in my health, not a ""cost"" of ""living badly"" that I need to convince myself to pay and attend.

I was watching some videos years ago and this line has always stuck in my mind.

""The best diet is the one you can follow.""

And it's right. Eat whatever it takes to make you feel good about yourself. And find the exercise that fits as well. Wellness isn't as simple as weighing a certain number, or eating ""the right foods"" or ""feeling good every day"". It's a combination of factors that ebbs & flows each day, and it's different of for everyone.

Try and find what works for you.

If it's not the exercise for you, don't keep doing it. You didn't fail just because you didn't like it, you succeeded in ruling out something on your journey to happiness.

If you like the exercise but aren't good at it, you're just a beginner, keep trying, you'll get better at it!",pilates,2018-12-09 22:50:12

I had no prior experience with pilates, and noticed how behind I am compared to other women in my class.

I had this idea that taller people aren’t as flexible...). I had watched several videos on YouTube on progressions, and how to master this, but still no dice. Anyway, I got a book from Brooke Siler (The Pilates Body) breaking down a bunch of moves, and wow! After months of struggling to do a proper OLR, my body actually figured out what to do.

In addition to the instructions and tips she stated, I started out by bending my knees to my chest and holding onto my legs right above my ankles. I did a few rocks back and forth to get into the groove of balancing and controlling the movement. After doing a few sets of those, my legs started straightening out in preparation to rock, and stayed straight throughout the movement! 

What I changed:
-tucking my chin to my chest
-making sure to engage my core enough (obvious, but tougher movements can cause sloppiness in the familiar components)
-not trying to pull my legs in as much, thus also keeping my arms pretty straight
-relaxing my mind, and letting intuition flow a bit more

1589999148.0,How much time,"Hi!  I started Pilates on the 15th.  I love it!  I wind up sweating my butt off even though I'm laying on the floor.  That is a new experience for me.  :)

I'm 40, female, overweight, and out of shape.  I'm now 6 days in, I've done 13 videos totaling 4.5 hours of Pilates.  They are mostly beginner videos that move slow and talk a lot about alignment and breathing and muscles.  

In just these 6 days I went from not being able to touch my toes, to being able to reach past my toes.  I couldn't put my legs straight when laying on my back, now I can.  I've also learned how to do a roll up or crunch or whatever it's called in pilates (still learning the lingo) without straining my neck.  That's a revelation!  I feel like I have already seen improvements in my core muscles, I'll take my second measurements tomorrow after 7 days.  I've challenged myself to 40 hours of pilates, so I'm not focused on results as much as on putting in the time and learning.  

I have a few questions I'm hoping you guys would be willing to answer for me.

1.  How much time per day would you recommend a beginner do pilates?  My goal is at least 40 minutes a day.  Should I bump it to an hour?
2. How long should I stay at the beginner level?  Right now it's challenging and I'm learning a lot, but I don't want to stunt my potential growth either.
3. Should I be sore?  I feel slightly sore in some muscles some days but mostly I feel very little soreness after the workouts.  I do feel the burn while doing the exercises though.  Sometimes I wonder if I'm not working hard enough if I'm not sore?
4. Joseph Pilates said you would have a whole new body after 30 sessions of Pilates.  What is considered a session?  An hour?

Any other thoughts or recommendations?  I'm so excited about this!  I've never EVER done an exercise regimen that I've actually enjoyed before.  The time on the mat just flies by.  It's great!",pilates,2020-05-20 18:25:48

1548756784.0,Tried pilates for the first time (recovering from trauma and chronic pain): loads of emotion.,"So, where to start? This has been quite a rollercoaster. Using this space to get this off my chest.

**tl;dr**: I'm recovering from a major physical trauma, which limit my physical ability. Went to my first pilates class; cried because I got confronted by the extent of my physical limitations, but happy I found a class where there is a lot of focus on individual needs and abilities. 

A few years ago I broke my ankle in a sports related accident. The injury was... bad. In the 20 months after my accident I had 7 surgeries to fix both my ankle and the slew of complications that followed. Right away I was told by my trauma surgeon I could forget about ever running a marathon in my life and the injury would most likely cause permanent impairment. 

I spend two years barely being able to walk and spending months at the time in wheelchairs and on crutches. And another year or two having chronic pain with every step being painful. I spend years going to PTs and such to recover and be able to walk again. The past year I have finally been pain free - at least when it comes to day to day activities. 

About 6 months ago, I decided to to tackle my physical fitness, which was very much non-existent. Quickly I realized I could not do *any* impact sports. Running hurts, jumping hurts, any kind of impact fucking hurts. And not the type of 'no pain no gain' hurt, but 'I'm actively fucking up my joints' hurt. The only things that didn't hurt (a lot) were walking and swimming, so that's what I focused on. My goal is to do a 60km hike this summer which is coming along nicely. 

My joints are very much fucked up. All ligaments in my bad ankle were damaged due to the break and many of them cut open several times during surgery. Those never really properly healed. My knee and hip on that side are weak because I've not been able to use them a lot. My ankle, knee and hip on the other side have been overcompensating for years (and therefor much, much stronger), and many of those ligaments are painful and chronically inflamed. Overall, I'm obviously extremely imbalanced.

I read about pilates and figured I should give it a try.. I mean, the man practically developed the system with people like me in mind! 

So off I went to my first mat class, where I didn't know anything or anyone. The class was nice. There were about 10 people of various ages, various bodies, and various level of fitness. The instructor was really good. With every exercise she gave examples of how to adapt the movements to make them more of less challenging, making sure to emphasize that none of the exercises should be painful, to focus on your ability and not compare yourself to your neighbors, and explaining where you're supposed to feel the strain. She walked around a lot to give advice as well. 

Guys.. I didn't realize how bad my injuries actually are. There was so much I was physically unable to do. Most of the standing exercises were painful and I can't actually bend my knees or hips while keeping my heels on the ground. The ground exercises when laying flat on my back were OK, I could do those, but those on my side were really hard. I am imbalanced to the point I can barely lie on my side without wobbling, let alone lift my leg(s) and do all kind of movements. All of this came on top of my lack of fitness, which meant I couldn't keep most of the pace anyway. I got quite emotional towards the end of the class.. cried on my way home because I was so disappointing with my body.

During class, there was this older woman who did not participate in half of the exercises (I'm guessing she also wasn't physically able to do most of them) and spend a lot of time on stretching and breathing exercises instead while the class continued. It was really nice to see how the people in this class were really focusing on their individual need and how everyone was working at their own pace, which made it easier for me to feel save not being able to do everything. 

I'm definitely going to keep up with these classes. My muscles are aching throughout my body today (but no pain in my joints!!) and I can definitely see how this will benefit me over time. I just need to acknowledge that this will be a loooong journey in which I really need to focus on *my* body and its individual needs and constraints.",pilates,2019-01-29 10:13:04

1588172117.0,"Swammer in lockdown, took up Youtube-led Pilates to finally address an old core injury while I have the time. Did my first successful roll up on day 18","As a swammer, for 15 years I have never had such a long break away from swimming, which I initially took up because of an injury that stopped me running, and which never improved. It felt like a core muscle injury, I would have pain if standing for long, or fairly quickly if I was leaning forward, could never go back running, despite multiple attempts. 

And then I became an obsessive long distance swimmer, usually over a million metres a year, and I am shall we just say no longer young.

This forced abstention led me to try to address the old injury with Pilates for which I never had the time previously. But with no class I started with the FAQ here. Tried a few different channels. 

Very quickly realised I couldn't do a hint of a roll-up.





I have been doing 6 days a week, from 30 to 45 minutes, trying a few different channels before I found a few that suited me in terms of variety and difficulty.  I'm good at doing exercises slowly and with concentration, comes from swimming I guess, so that helps. 


It's too early to say for sure, but I think I detect improvements in my core/back issue. But the real feeling I was improving was being able to some roll ups Monday & today, where before they had been impossible. 

Couldn't do any yesterday mind you. And I can only do them if they are early in the set. 

But I can also now transition from extended arm front plank to extended arm side plank, which was impossible also in the first two weeks.

Anyway, interesting. Rarely in swimming does improvement manifest like this.",pilates,2020-04-29 14:55:17

1582895840.0,Quick /Pilates story and a thank you 🙏,"I just want to give a quick shout out to all /Pilates instructors. I am in a fairly low populated area but blessed to have what I feel is a very knowledgeable Pilates instructor who always makes time for me. 

I have had left hip discomfort for probably the last 12 to 15 years with TFL tightness, IT band pain, chronically tight psoas, tight glute medius, and a gait that never felt quite natural, and I’ve spent countless hours with many different physical therapists and doctors being massaged manipulated, dry needled, and prescribed probably a hundred different exercises.

I saw her on Monday and she said she wanted to look me over and check some things since I haven’t seen her in a few years. Simply,  she said, you have no arch in your low back, especially your left side, and you’re activating with your psoas before your glutes.  

She moved my body into what she said was neutral and said “that feels weird doesn’t it “ and I said yeah, it does not feel natural.   She said “well that is your neutral -you work on doing that this week “.  She also prescribed a couple stretches and a quadruped leg extension exercise focusing on maintaining a slight arch in my back and keeping a TA connection, and not letting my ASIS disconnect.  She said work on those things only and come back and see me in one week.

It is Friday now and I Cannot express how excited and happy I am. My gait Feels natural and everything else it’s loosening up with much less pain. I can’t believe something that simple made such a difference in my life.  

Posture first!  It’s seems like such simple concept yet the health industry does not seem to ever address it.  At least with me they never did.",pilates,2020-02-28 13:17:20

The first 28 days I went along with Rachel Lawrence's 28-day challenge after being sedentary with a desk job WFH. (I weighed about 150 lbs; tend to gain weight in my abdomen and legs first, then arms last).

The second 30 days I spent going along with YT videos from IsaWelly. (Not a challenge, just a list of 30 videos I chose at random and put into my Google Calendar). (I weighed about 147 lbs here).

For the next 30 days, I'm revisiting the Rachel Lawrence challenge to see if I'll get similar results as the first time. (I'm about 145 lbs starting here). My goal is to recomp and stay around 145-150 lbs.

Here are my thoughts:

1. 30 minutes of any activity is completely doable and sustainable. I'll view this as a lifestyle change, a segue into more difficult workouts (calisthenics and heavy weightlifting) in the next few years. I want to focus more on stability, balance, mobility, and flexibility before adding more into my regimen.
2. The first 30 days seem the most drastic after being completely sedentary for 4-5 years, including 2 bouts of COVID. It's possible that it may take me several more months to get the outcome I want, a more toned, lean look.
3. I'm considering getting a gym membership or at least moving into a complex with better equipment.
4. Some moves are slowly getting easier (like side planks, rollups, full planks, hip bridges). The ones that were extremely hard when I started are pretty much still difficult but I do feel an increased tolerance for core work and no pain in my neck like when I started.

Do you see a change from the 30 day to 60 day pics? I find it difficult to tell the difference but maybe 30 days of pilates is just enough for slight changes. This time next year I hope to be significantly different.

Do you have any advice for continuing on with pilates and strength training? Challenges, YTers, apps, etc?",pilates,2023-07-14 14:13:15
1684890460.0,"Instructors: do you ever stumble over your words? Advice for dealing with a student’s comments. (Sorry, long)","Hi Pilates People! I’ve been teaching group fitness for a while (yoga for 10 years, pilates for 5), and I’ve never been a particularly good public speaker. When I’m tired I tend to lose my words a bit, and sometimes I have a slight stutter. Often I’ll throw out a cue and realize saying it differently would have been much more effective. I‘ve tried really hard to correct this (and it’s getting better), but I know I’ll never be the smoothest talker, and my students usually follow along perfectly fine so I try not to stress about it. 

However, I have one student in particular who has been very rude. Today I was running on low sleep so it was happening more than usual, and she kept making snide comments to the person next to her during class. The person she was talking to wasn’t engaging at all (and actually looked uncomfortable with the comments). At one point I overheard this student mutter “wow, she could have just said it like this” and it was like the 10th comment she’d made, so I stopped class and asked her to relay her feedback to me. She froze up and refused to repeat it, and then was quiet for the rest of class. I felt guilty and like I had made the class awkward for everyone. I think my cueing issues get so much worse around this student because I’m worried she’s judging me. I have some classes where it’s less of a problem because the students that come are nice and I’m not stressed about it. But this is getting to my head, and I feel like my teaching confidence is taking a hit because of this student. 

So two questions for you experienced instructors- do you stumble over your words? Is this just a me problem? And have you ever had rude students in class and how did you handle it? I’m considering just pulling this student aside after class and talking to her. I know that the owner of our studio has already had a conversation with this student (I’m not the only instructor she’s been rude to- she seems to have a different issue with all of us) but maybe it would be more effective coming from the teacher.",pilates,2023-05-24 01:07:40

I'm currently working with a PT to lose some weight. I'm in a calorie deficit and strength training 4x a week on top of Pilates 5-6x a week. I feel as if I should be adding in a bit of cardio in there but my PT said that I would be getting enough cardio from my Pilates classes. Personally I don't think I'm burning that much in a class to consider it cardio since my heart rate doesn't go up that much. What are your opinions on this? Should I add 10-20mins of cardio after my sessions or continue with my plan as is? I will bring it up with my PT at our next check in but just wanted some second opinions.

Personally I believed I had recovered due to the lack of pain, howeber after a bit of humbling and self reflection it's quite clear I still have a lot of strengthening/conditioning to do & I'm pretty certain pilates will help that. 

Secondly, the ethos within the session was spot on. For a bit of context it was what I believe to be mat pilates(?) - little/no equipment other than a squishy ball thingy and like a foam block for the head - (do apologise I don't yet know the terminology!! ), and the instructor we had was fantastic. She would provide exercises with other variations so that there are differing degress of difficulty. It seems like pilates is something you only get out what you put in with terms of effort - but knowing that on the exercises I am better at I can tweak the difficulty and vice versa for the exercises I am struggling with takes away so much anxiety for future classes. Pilates appears to be perfect for those who are worrying about getting started due to the fear of not being any good as you can tweak the class to your own level to better your experience - also for anyone worried about looking daft I can gurantee that everyone else there are too focused on bettering themselves that they do not pay you any attention at all.

Thirdly, I came out soooo relaxed which I'm putting down to the emphasis on breathing. There was no tension or stress leaving that room after I finished, just laughs and smiles all round. I do believe the instructor had a part to play in this because not a single second felt like a chore; it felt much more like an oppurtunity to help and improve your body - maybe some of the more experienced people on this sub can shed some light on whether this is an international benefit or if its dependent on the class type/instructor. 

Finally, I realised just how stiff my muscles are. As an ex-amature rugby player I truly took a humbling doing these classes. I'm excited for my muscles to become more flexible, & my mind-muscle relationship to improve with more sessions and I'm hoping they will have a knock on effect and make me more efficient within other exercises I am planning to start in the future, such as climbing and weightlifting. 

As you can tell I really enjoyed my first session and will certainly be going again next week. Hopefully in a few months I will be able to provide an update on how pilates has positively affected my life. I also want to thank everyone from the community who provided some insight into my first session on my previous post - you lot certainly made that first session a lot more comfortable with your tips and what to expect. 

Tl;dr - Pilates humbled me in the best of ways",pilates,2023-05-18 21:07:35
1673017492.0,"Beginner overwhelmed with options, please advise!","Hi everyone, I'm looking to get into pilates and after browsing this subreddit, I'm overwhelmed with how to start!

I'm looking to start at home, no equipment (I mean I have yoga blocks, but no reformer machine or whatever that thing is). I really want something with pre-scheduled classes so I don't have to just search ""pilates"" on YouTube every day and sift through thousands of options. I'm open to either YouTube or an affordable monthly cost app.

My goals (31F) are to tone up and heal adrenal fatigue from years of weight training that left me puffy and, well, thick but not in a cute way. I've been really inspired seeing other posts on this sub about others who have the same fitness history finally enjoying working out again with pilates. That's me. I hate HIIT or dance cardio stuff as well, so I'm looking for something that's a middle ground between Grandma Pilates and HIIT dance Xtreme nonsense. I want to know what platforms you all have actually seen transformation and results with.

I've seen these recommended on this sub and am not sure where to start or the differences between them or who will help me actually achieve results over time:

Move with Nicole
Moving Mango
Flow with Mira
B the Method (really interested in trying this?)
Margaret Elizabeth
Beth Sandlin

As you can probably guess from this post, I don't want to try each one and decide, that's just too overwhelming, so I'm just looking for one or two of the most recommended ones that will be worth the time I spend to see results.

1662002505.0,My Pilates classes have left me feeling really demotivated about my home workouts- how wrong can I really get it?,"I started doing daily Pilates workouts from home about two months ago, using mostly Jessica Valant videos. I’ve never been able to maintain any kind of exercise program before but found myself really looking forward to doing it every day. I noticed significant improvements to my strength and sense of connection to my body really quickly and was feeling really enthusiastic.

I booked some private mat Pilates lessons because I thought it would be prudent to make sure I was doing things correctly, improve my form, avoid any risk of injury etc.

The classes have been really enjoyable and informative in their own right, but more than anything it’s made me feel that I am doing things SO wrong at home. The same exercises in-person are so much more strenuous and often feel like they’re working out entirely different muscles. I feel much weaker than I thought I was. This is what I came to find out, but it’s left me feeling so dejected.

I am finding it extremely difficult to put many of the things I’m learning into practice when alone at home, without having someone there to correct me, reposition me etc. I don’t have the time or resources to keep taking classes, but where before I would be excited about my home workouts, now I just feel like it’s a bit pointless.

I’m wondering what I should do. I’m considering maybe I should take reformer classes to build up my strength? I really want to keep working out at home but I feel like I’m wasting my time doing it all wrong & just not sure where to go from here.",pilates,2022-09-01 03:21:45

I started to work out lifting weights ever since I started to have neck/back pain from my office job. Lots and lots of sitting and keyboarding!! 

Lifting weights is an excellent work out no doubt but I realized unless I have a complete understanding of proper form, lifting weights may do more harm than good. 
Which is one of the reason why I transitioned to Pilates. Correct form is also required, I find Pilates is much more forgiving. 

After 3 years of Pilates training I wanted to really dig into it. I also find being an instructor in an activity which I have a lot of faith, is more fulfilling than my current desk job.

1610656651.0,Diversity and the Pilates Method Alliance,"I haven't seen it discussed here yet so I wanted to bring it up! There is a lot to talk about and I'm probably going to accidentally miss things and I think [Misty Lynne Cauthen](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CKCBH03jUnl/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) says it best here.

TL;DR: The PMA is a cashcow (their 2018 financials show they pulled in around 250k of revenue from the conference and the president Elizabeth Andersen earns about 150k as a salary) and absolutely worthless as a professional organization and the NPCP program is the same. The only reason they continue to remain somewhat relevant is because of their stranglehold on continuing education credits. They gatekeep and they tokenize  - where are the male board members? Where are the larger bodied teachers?  How are they promoting and advancing Pilates as a profession exactly? By having a certification that requires CECs? Seems good, thanks. Even post trademark lawsuit (I wasn't a teacher then) I'm not sure they really were working to heal the schism created by Sean Gallagher.

Why this is relevant is oftentimes the advice that is given here with regards to finding a teacher is that a PMA Certified (now NCPT) teacher is best and I bought into that hype myself as a teacher.  I  took the test which incredibly easy - the written test out for the my teacher training program was more difficult so I ticked the box.

Then COVID-19 happened. The PMA response to COVID-19 was lacking with a few blogs and webinars.  Then the murder of George Floyd happened.  Their response to the murder of George Floyd was a blacked out square and a statement and 2 black women (Stella Hull-Lampkin and Nicky Taylor Steward) being appointed to the PMA board and 2 black women (Eurona Tilley and Tabatha Koylass ) being elected to the board.

The [PMA then created a photo contest soliciting photos of diverse instructors](https://www.instagram.com/p/CITKObrABa3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) which was problematic with #diversifypilates.

A few weeks ago there was a PMA town hall meeting.  [Here is the link to the replay](https://www.pilatesmethodalliance.org/Shared_Content/PMA-Blog/Community/Our-Town-Hall-Meeting---Opening-Communication-about-Diversity-in-Pilates.aspx).

On Monday all [4 black board members resigned](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJ9IoT7gKiI/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). They had to sign an NDA so effectively they were silenced from day 1. 

My PMA membership is up. I'm not renewing. I don't need discounts on grip socks and generalized advice from a professional organization that doesn't actually seem interested in serving the teachers sustaining the industry. Even if you're not a member, we can hold the single professional org of our industry accountable.

It's not so bad that I can't do anything, I feel good and I wanna go again today, but then I wonder when I'll be able to do my normal workout if I do pilates 2 or 3 times a week. I don't wanna overwork my muscles/not give them enough time to rest, I don't know how much pilates affects that?

Any thoughts?",pilates,2020-02-25 10:11:49

Since then I have signed up for about 30 classes, 28 group and 2 privates. While Pilates has alleviated my back pain I still get horrible anxiety before and during class to the point where I feel like I can't fully focus on instructor cues which causes even more anxiety because I'm doing the moves incorrectly and the instructor has to correct me in front of the class. 

The studios I go to are not accepting new clients for privates so I attend group classes (anywhere from 3-8 students including myself). Any advice on how to manage anxiety during group classes?

1676792045.0,"Bad Class Today (Vent, Advice Welcome)","Please tell me if I'm acting irrationally. 

I do pilates roughly 5x weekly, with 1-2 privates mixed in. The instructors I typically do 1:1 with have between 10-20 years of teaching experience, and I've been doing pilates for some time, but I don't think I'm god's gift to pilates or anything. At my normal studio, I usually sit in small, intermediate-to-advanced classes that require permission from the instructor before joining, but I know I have *a lot* to learn. 

I've recently added a a new studio to my rotation. This was the studio I started at about ten years ago, and I've decided to go back there to begin my teacher training, because the owner is incredible. The classes are usually booked months out, so I usually slide into a class whenever there's a last-minute availability. Today I had a teacher I have never worked with before. 

She introduced me to everyone in the class by name, informed me that they were like a ""Saturday family."" Cool! She asked me if I'd ever done pilates before. I said ""yes."" I don't usually go into how much experience I have (I like my body to speak for me in class), but because I'm excited about this studio's teacher certification program, I mentioned I had signed up and would be starting in May. She seemed really excited for me, but in a kind of condescending way. Wait until I learned about things like the cadillac or wunda chair! I do multiple sessions on both apparatus a week, but didn't want to sound like a know-it-all. I just reiterated I was excited for the program. 

She proceeded to correct my form and no one else's the entire class. 

At one point during basic feet in straps she came over and lifted my headrest up on the reformer. I prefer not to use a headrest on the reformer, and I don't know why she only lifted mine (she offered no explanation, just ""here, let me lift this for you), when no one else had a lifted headrest. At another point in class, she corrected my form when the guy in front of me was doing the exact same thing but even more exaggerated. She spent over half the class just standing next to my bed, asking multiple times, ""Do you need my help? Have you done this before?"" 

The thing is, I don't trust classes where the teacher never corrects form. That's how I get better. I welcome a good micro-adjustment, I want to be doing things right, but this instructor was just focused on me and no one else. She never said one thing about another person. This class was fairly beginner level, and it made me feel embarrassed and bullied the entire class. 

I was able to grab a few more openings at this studio over the next month, but one class is being taught with the same instructor. I'm wondering if I should cancel, or if I should tough it out and act like this didn't bother me. Am I overreacting here? How would y'all deal with this situation?",pilates,2023-02-19 07:34:05
1676767061.0,Difficulty figuring out what the cues for body posture/activation mean,"I am particularly struggling with the “scoop your belly” and “activate your glutes”. In general I struggle to follow oral directions and have to look around a lot, but those are not something I can peek at a neighbor to figure out. 
I cannot suck in my belly fat (it’s the only really fat part of my body) and the good instructor at my studio tried to help me today but got frustrated. She was describing it as a corset but corsets don’t go to the lower abdomen except the later S curve ones which can’t be what she means. I’ve also read here and through googling that it doesn’t mean sucking in because that messes up breath flow. I’m just really lost. I’ve also read that glute activation isn’t squeezing the butt because that messes up the lower back. I’m really hesitant to do postures wrong because of past back problems (most resolved now post reduction surgery but I’m paranoid). 
I’ve been having terrible neck pain so I’ve been trying to focus on not messing up the upper back curls and have kind of figured out a way to do them but still intermittent neck pain.
Is there a way for someone without a good sense of translating words into small movements to figure out proper form?
We were doing a movement today with gliders pushing arms forward and she said I should feel it in my core but even making adjustments she suggested it was in my shoulders, and a similar leg activity I only felt in my knees.",pilates,2023-02-19 00:37:41

I work full time and this would be a “side job” and for passion, and when I mentioned this to an instructor they seemed discouraging. 

Is this a suitable thing to pursue while working full time, or not worth it? The impression I had was mainly “don’t do it unless you have bunches of time and are extremely knowledgeable”, which was a bit upsetting as 1) this instructor doesn’t fully know me and 2) didn’t seem supportive of me pursuing this while having a corporate career.

After 6months of doing random YT videos, whichever I liked, I am at that point where I really want to know how do people progress? Do you do that same video again and again or different random videos everyday? Do you follow the same person or switch between different coaches(online)

Another thing is, I'm from a small town in india and here, we do not have dedicated pilates gym.

1656511410.0,Red Flags with Clients - Is this Common?,"My Pilates business is so new (as in <2 weeks) that I don’t have a LinkedIn Account. I’ve advertised Pilates instruction on instagram and kijiji and I’ve been building my website. 

So far 2 potential clients have reached out to me via the kijiji add. There were many red flags with the 1st client. I’m not sure how useful sharing my experience with this individual is, but maybe it’ll give a heads up to others starting up a small business and booking appointments.

The client called me on Monday at 9pm for the free intro session. They say never to pick up a business call after hours or your CNS will become habituated to turning on your fight/flight mode at all times of day. I was excited to receive this first call however, so I picked up. 

I wanted to book a 15-minute intro session but the client asked if we could talk now briefly. He seemed depressed. I thought it could do no harm to make an exception for a potential first client. We went through a postural analysis, his health, his goals. And then he spoke for some time about his uncertainties working out and his bad experiences with previous trainers who only seemed interested in money. He apologized for taking an hour of my time instead of 15 minutes. He said that he didn’t understand how to make an e-transfer and wanted to speak later for a tutorial. I told him it would be no problem and we could do a Zoom screen share for 5-10 minutes later. 

The next morning, on Tuesday, I sent him an email with a thank you letter for reaching out, his proposed schedule, and a infographic of his next steps. 

He then texted me at 9pm again that night asking if I could chat. I texted him back that I’m unable to meet virtually now, as I’m with my family, but he could call me during business hours. He then called me and I was shocked and ignored it. He called again, and I picked up feeling peeved and curious. 

The client apologized and asked if we could just have a zoom call to go over how to make an e-transfer now. He said that he could send the money over to me for the online Pilates classes tonight. 

I agreed, feeling peeved but thinking that it would be a start to my business. My first income with my business. 

It was on me to start with a question about how his day was going instead of diving into the invoice. He seemed depressed and self-critical and I asked him if he’d like to do a 5 minute settling meditation which he declined. 

He then offered to pay me $125 per online Pilates class - roughly double my advertised price. 

He asked me if I would be willing to meet in person if he wanted to give me a larger sum of money, like $5000. I told him it wouldn’t be necessary to pay for that many classes in advance. TD Bank has a $3000 e-transfer cap per week so he’d be covered paying monthly at $1500. 

He seemed frustrated and then asked me if I could be assertive a few times. I now began to suspect that he wanted something outside of Pilates instruction. I began to get the vibe that he had a fetish for submission. He wanted me to say, ""You have no choice. You have to do this."" I nervously began to wonder how to end the Zoom meeting and let him know that I would not be able to work with him. I told him it was already 10:20pm and tried to end the conversation.

The client continued to mention the e-transfer and paying me. He said he wanted to help me out. That his money could be used to buy a Reformer. 

Then he said he was afraid to tell me what he needed because he was nervous that I’d stop working with him. This made me feel very uncomfortable. I felt angry at this point and told him he needed to tell me his needs so I know if it’s a good fit working together. I was already certain at this point that I didn’t want to work with him but I felt curious to have my suspicions validated. 

He said he’d let me know in the morning after sleeping on it. 

After our call, I immediately drew up an invoice for our call of $50 which he agreed to pay during the call. 

I called my boyfriend who said he already thought the client was very fishy from the Monday conversation, since he called after 9pm and spoke for so long. I felt a bit stupid for being patient with the client and caring about his description of his rough day/life. I suspected that he was depressed, anxious and possible schizophrenic. 

Today, I’ll be emailing the client that I don’t believe his needs align with the Pilates services that I’m offering. I doubt he’ll pay the invoice for the 60 minute talk yesterday. 

A part of me is wondering why my first client with Pilates Colours just had to leave me feeling so icky and used. 

A small business is a hard thing to own and operate. Things hit you that you’d never expect. But am I going to give up? Hell no! But I wonder if others have experienced similar things with their clients. My very first client coming in this form makes me feel that perhaps it’s a common thing.",pilates,2022-06-29 14:03:30

I've tried doing pilates with Blogilates' YouTube channel, and I like her exercise routines.

1629125717.0,How much Pilates should one do,"I hear this question again and again.  There’s no one answer for everyone.  You have to think about what you want out of your practice. In the beginning stages you’re learning both new movements and new ways of moving. This takes consistent practice and repetition. Imagine if you were learning a new language, would one hour per week with no homework or practice in between get you very far? No. For many people only one class a week is like groundhogs day, starting from scratch each time with little to no memory of what was done a week ago. It takes a long time to actually learn like that. And if you want to really change your body only one hour a week is not enough to build new strength and flexibility. If once a week is working for you, great! But if you feel you want more results then you need to do more. Like anything you get back what you put in. A home practice is very beneficial and can even be just 15 minutes of mat work. You’ll only improve in Pilates through practice. You can’t wait until you’re “good at it” to practice.  Practice things you know are appropriate for you but know that these exercises are meant to be a challenge so struggling means your doing it right!  Pain is never good but being confused about things and feeling muscles fatigue is normal. No one got good at these exercises right away. After over 30 years I am still learning and improving because I’m still practicing.  Pilates is a practice",pilates,2021-08-16 14:55:17

I am a naturally anxious person who likes to avoid predictable problems, so my number one fear is hurting myself. I feel like I would not only need a reformer, but some floor to ceiling mirrors--ultimately I wanted to know if the people who actually do have reformers at home are they just super wealthy and constantly book private sessions multiple days a week or is there a happy medium of completed self-guided workouts in combination with studio classes or periodic private lessons. My gut says it's a bad idea no matter what. Compared to yoga, it seems like doing a pilates teacher training is way more involved and a much greater expense--many yoga schools make a good portion of their money training people who simply wish to deeper their practice, which does not seem parallel here.",pilates,2023-08-29 21:51:40

It seems important to market yourself as a Pilates instructor online, especially on Instagram where fitness content is popular. I was thinking that creating an Instagram account for my Pilates practice would help to get myself out there in the community and that it would be nice to see my progression in the Pilates practice throughout my training with an account dedicated to just that.

However, I recently redownloaded Instagram for the first time in years and I feel quite intimidated. I wouldn’t want my mental health to be impacted by it again.

Instructors, what is your advice? Do you have an Instagram for your practice, and do you feel that it is in your best interest as an instructor to have an account (especially for marketing purposes)? Let me know your input, thank you!",pilates,2023-04-20 06:04:37

1660853077.0,Abdominals in Pilates,"Pilates is known for its abdominal work. Unfortunately it’s become overly obsessed about because Pilates is truly a full body conditioning system.  

The role of the abdominal muscles is to move the pelvis and spine and stabilize the pelvis and spine, depending on what movements you’re doing. The abdominal muscles don’t “protect” the spine… Pilates isn’t something dangerous and your back doesn’t need protection from it.  The abs don’t need to be held tight or braced. Muscles engage through moving. We don’t need to grip or squeeze or tense. Finding the connection of the deepest abs can be challenging but this is where a skilled teacher is vital. But with good form and breathing your muscles will often do their job without needing to think too about what muscles are engaging.  The exercises are designed to activate the bodies natural movement patterns.  As a beginner it’s best to learn from a teacher who can watch and guide you because you’re learning a system of exercises and form is important.  But once you know the basics you should be able to just do the exercises and focus on the whole body experience without the need to ever be gripping, squeezing, tightening or bracing muscles.  None of those things are how movement is meant to be. We don’t squeeze our leg muscles to make walking happen. We let the movement of our body activate itself appropriately.  

Our bodies are made to move and Pilates movements are safe and healthy.  You don’t need to “protect” your back or tighten or brace your muscles. Pilates is about finding fluid and efficient movement.  Not tension.",pilates,2022-08-18 20:04:37
1659309725.0,Really difficult instructor,"I have been going to Club Pilates for about 6 months and I really love it! I can see huge improvements in my strength and see changes in my body shape. I normally do 1.0 classes but once a week a 1.5 due to my schedule restraints.  But I can keep up ok in the 1.5 and feel fine afterwards.  

A new instructor though, is killing me lol. Her 1.0 class is more what I expect of 1.5. And her 1.5 is brutal. I know how I feel when overexerting myself. However she now teaches 3 days in a row at the times I can go. So skipping her completely is not feasible. 

My question is should I say something or just take breaks as I feel I need it? A few people made comments like wow you are a tough teacher and she laughed it off saying sorry this is how I teach. I want to ask if she can give modifications down, the way other teachers give modifications up? Or just do the best I can? 

I kinda think its rude, teachers are supposed to know where their students are and teach from there. If I was ready for 2.0 classes I would sign up for them. I don't want to risk an injury or feel exhausted later in the day. I feel like modifying on my own is not ideal because I don't know what she is doing next. So if I take it easy on something and we don't do another round of that, then I won't have gotten the exercise I expected.",pilates,2022-07-31 23:22:05

2005 - 2013  built my own studio full of equipment and it all works great. Strong and solid. And easy to build. I then developed plans based on the strong equipment I had built. In 2013, I launched   [**http://Pilates-Equipment-Plans.com/**](http://pilates-equipment-plans.com/) selling basic/partial  instructions  ('beta plans'). Then came five years of clients' feedback, further testing, and revising the original 'beta plans'.

I understand that Pilates makes you stronger and more flexible. Better posture. But I guess I’m struggling to understand if it helps with muscle definition. Of course you need to trim down, eat better. Your muscles won’t be exposed under a lot of fat with any kind of working out. 

I guess what I’m asking is to those that are trim, or a healthy weight, have you seen Pilates help with muscle definition?

Good teachers become good because they have experience teaching and focus on their craft as teachers and on their students.  Not on curating a perfect image.  

Look for teachers with credentials and experience.  Listen to their instructions and cues as those will be what help you learn, not looking at how “perfect” they look and how well they do the exercises.   Those things won’t help you learn.

1672891751.0,Options for online workout.,"Hi guys and gals, I have this list for all those who have reformers or even just want to do mat pilates online. I've tried every one of these and I will share which ones are my fave.

1. Speir pilates on demand - my favorite and go to. Has weekly full length reformer and mat pilates videos. This is good if you like to use various equipment with your reformer like weighted balls, pilates ring, ankle weights, etc.  Her cues are so good that you don't have to look at the video to know what she is doing.

2. Vive active stream - my other favorite. Streamed from the Australia studio.. it has both livestreamed and on demand full-length..both reformer and mat 

3. Natural pilates tv - this one is the cheapest. Both full length and mini classes for reformer and mat.. and several livestreamed classes that come with the membership.

4. Amanda blaur  - purely mat pilates, very good cuing

5. Kara Duval pilates  - one of the best mat pilates I've ever done. Has great modern twists to her signature class.  I recommend everyone to give her a try, so an amazing disposition and will give you a good deal if you cannot afford her membership. Very communicative 

6.  Pilates noir - love her aesthetic and music. More of a pilates flow..mat pilates

7. Pilates fit boutique- amazing offering from New Zealand studio. All 30 minute workouts on the mat and has a cardio element to it. For anyone who gets bored easily and want a fast paced workout, she's the one. 

8. Lesley Logan pilates - this is primarily for those who are advanced. Every week, she provides a new workout for chair, tower, mat, and reformer which goes away when new workouts get posted. The most expensive on the list, but a lot of advanced pilates people love her. And her cuing is by far the best.

9. Ara movement - has a variety of both mat and reformer. She's pricey for what she is offering though. I'm a person of consistency, and I love when it's the same every week when it comes to length. I don't like 14 minutes here and there and sometimes a 45 minute every other moon cycle. But her videos are professional 

10. Dynamic pilates tv - very extensive of various apparatus.. better than anytime pilates website in my own opinion

11. Level up with Laurie- I love her signature pilates classes.. its a combo of cardio barre and pilates that uses bands, weights, sliders. She's amazing. The videos are recorded from her class.

12.  Hot pilates on demand

13. Function studios on demand

14. Rise pilates - great offering for both reformer and mat

15. Eve by taylor - her signature pilates workouts are my go to fave right now. Everyone should try it. She is offering 7 day trial for a limited time

16. O44 way by Carrie Dorr-  my other current fave. A mix of pilates, barre, and cardio.. using her signature box with band. Its pricey to start but highly recommended",pilates,2023-01-05 04:09:11
1669924221.0,How to prevent toenail fungus or athlete's foot in reformer classes?,"Hi all. I've been a consistent Pilates student for years. Recently, I got toenail fungus for unknown reasons and had to have my big toenails removed. Obviously, I don't want this to happen again. My podiatrist recommended ""yoga socks"" to prevent re-infection, but my Pilates studio owner doesn't like those socks. Is there anything I can do besides yoga socks to prevent possible contamination of foot/toenail fungus on the reformer machine? We do have wipes at my studio, but I doubt that they are enough if they aren't anti-microbial. Plus, the loops for feet-in-straps are fabric, and I don't believe that wipes would get rid of fungus in them.

Edit to clarify: Socks are very much allowed. The owner just said she doesn't prefer them herself. I've noticed that most people don't wear the socks, but a minority do.",pilates,2022-12-01 19:50:21

I sort of said yes to almost every opportunity to get enough hours and ended up with an awkward schedule, and now I need to cut back. 

I teach single one class at a studio that pays far below the other two and adds another commute to my day. I’ve only been teaching there for three weeks but I’m already realizing that I want to let it go. I think only teaching at two places will still give me enough income but I’ll save myself a commute. I’m also in school so the more efficient I can make my schedule the better! But I’m struggling with how to tell the studio owner in a way that doesn’t burn the bridge (it’s a small Pilates world!) and doesn’t put her in a rough spot. They added this class when I started because they needed more classes, the class has been full all three weeks I’ve taught it, and I know they’ve struggled to find teachers to fill the schedule so they’d probably have to cancel the class (at least temporarily) if I leave. People are already canceling memberships because they can’t get off the waitlist for classes, and I don’t want to exacerbate that. Has anyone ever been in this situation? Any advice for leaving gracefully?",pilates,2022-09-05 16:44:45
1656349129.0,Should reformer leg work be harder?,"I'm a 45 years old male, 6'3"", in decent shape, and most of pilates is very pleasantly challenging for me... with one exception. 

Traditional pilates leg work on a reformer. It's too easy 

I'm referring to the series where you basicallly do squats laying down on the carriage with toes in v-formation, heels at the corner, toes on the bars, etc.

None of it is hard for me at all.

I put all the springs on, but it still feels like I'm barely working. And so, I focus on form instead, and it ends up being more of a meditative excerise for me (which is very pleasant!)

And maybe that's ok? Maybe it shouldn't be a rigorous burn? Or maybe these machines are slightly better optimized for shorter people and/or women? 

Or, perhaps there is some modification I could be doing? I asked my instructor and she said just keep doing what I'm doing.

Any advice?

EDIT: Looks like I was using the wrong terminology. The exercises I'm referring to are called footwork, not leg work. Thanks for the correction, friends.",pilates,2022-06-27 16:58:49

I used to be really into the gym when I was in college (not classes, doing exercises like lunges/squats etc with weights) and at the time my butt had toned up and was bigger than now, but it’ll never be a “big butt”. I’m fine with that - I’m rly just looking to get it back into shape and have it lifted/toned.

I am a student of Pilates who has signed up for teaching training thru Balanced Body and taken out a large loan to complete instructorship over the next 6 months. I do a lot of sports that cause imbalances like climbing and snowboarding. I want to help train all mtn athletes for these issues. 

Today I was doing a private lesson with my teacher. I have a weak chest from being a rock climber (I also used to swim), so a lot the exercises focus on correcting upper cross syndrome and my knock knees. We use a lot of magic circle on the outside of my legs and stretches that are specific to help with my posture. 

Anyways, after my second private lesson (I also take group classes) I was driving back home and I felt a sweep of deep emotion like what yogis might refer to as ""enlightenment"". Its hard to describe but I'll use some flowery language to try... it was like a reverse panic attack, where instead of my life force being pulled out of me like a crashing  wave, and segmenting my emotions from my existence, my soul feels like its realigning with my body, or someone is sweeping cobwebs off of my neurons, or stress is dripping off me like honey, or my residual trauma from life was being sent out of me, or my mind was being opened. It was utterly euphoric. I thought I was tripping or something. I mean I started crying, but it was tears of joy and forgiveness. It was overwhelming. 

I'm wondering if this retraining of my fundamental movement has some kind of positive neurological connection. I haven't taken my anatomy classes yet. I wonder if anyone else has had an experience like this. I know that pilates doesn't have a spiritual underpinnings like yoga but I was wondering if anyone has practical knowledge on the psychological effects of pilates or spinal realignment might be like.

My name is Kaleen and I’m the founder of Flexia.  We help people build strength, flexibility, and mindfulness with our smart Pilates Reformer and online studio of classes.

You may have seen us mentioned in a few posts here and there, and I wanted to say hello myself!  This community is referenced again and again by some of our customers as a fantastic resource for their practice, so I wanted to take the opportunity to jump in and answer your questions about Pilates, Pilates equipment, and how we’re using technology to quantify the Pilates Reformer experience.

Quick background on me: I’m a mechanical engineer, Pilates instructor, and former owner of The Fit Reformer, a Pilates equipment maintenance company.  I used to work for a major Pilates equipment brand as an engineer.  I’ve been teaching Pilates since 2014 in a studio setting, and getting my hands dirty on Pilates equipment of all brands since 2015.

I started Flexia to make Pilates on a Reformer more accessible at home through three mediums:

1. A professional-grade Reformer that fits more body sizes and has some home-friendly features (like wheels and the ability to stand on end for storage).
2. An online studio of scalable, intelligent, inclusive classes of varying lengths, skill levels, and focuses to fit where you’re at.
3. Technology that senses carriage movement to provide you real-time feedback specific to each exercise, track your progress, and make smart recommendations about what to do next.

I welcome your questions and look forward to chatting!

Due to some health issues (I won't go into detail) I can't lift heavy nor can I do too many exercises like squats or lunges but I still want a nice butt and legs! I'm 5'1 and 110 lbs and I'm not really an active person. I've recently looked into plilates exercises such as donkey kicks, leg kick backs etc with ankle weights. I was wondering if these would help lift and make my butt rounder (not necessarily bigger) if also eat enough protein and calories. Exercise suggestions are also welcome!

1558267899.0,Is pilates once a week enough (if combined with other exercise)?,"Hey all. I took a few months of pilates several years ago and I really loved it, and I'm looking to start again. I'm trying to lose a little weight (I'm not overweight, but a little above my ideal), get a little toned, and most importantly — improve my posture! Lately I've been having a lot of body aches and it's just too early for that at 27. 

In any case, I want to take individual reformer pilates (I've tried group and mat classes, both don't really do it for me), but as these are the most expensive classes, I wanted to know if once a week is enough? I'll still be hitting the gym 2-3 times a week, mostly cardio and light weights. All the trainers and classes tell me that 3x a week is the *minimum* if I want to see any effect at all, and if this is true then it won't really be viable for me, so I wanted to hear an unbiased opinion.

1668675923.0,Poor experience with Body Concept (first Asia approved PSAP school)- thoughts?,"This is my first post after lurking for a while and I am writing this so that potential practitioners considering Body Concept academy know what they are signing up for. 

Some background, I have done Pilates for approx 2 years and am currently based in China. I enjoy Pilates and go for classes 3x to 4x a week. Hence, decided to take the leap to get certified. The decision to go to Pilates school is more for personal growth and understanding anatomy/exercises better, not intending to pursue a full-time career as an instructor (for now!) 

Since I would be based on China for a while, I decided to try out Body Concept (henceforth referred to as BC) over the more established academies such as Balanced Body and Stott for a couple of reasons: 

* BC is actually very popular in China currently where many teachers across first and second tier cities (e.g. Shanghai, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Xiamen) are purely BC-trained, with no “cross” training with other academies  
* They have a lot of partnerships and events for the 'gram (dancing on the reformer in an old warehouse looking space??)  that probably makes it look legit and professional.
* China is the only place where one can learn BC so I thought why not since I would be able to get certified in Balanced Body, Stott, Polestar etc back home 
* The comprehensive programme (42,800RMB/6000USD) is held across 6 months, 4 days straight each time (24 days in total). The reformer programme (20,000RMB/2800USD) is held across 3 months, 4 days straight each time (12 days in total). Seems quite structured 
* The T&Cs for signing up was onerous, which I mistakenly assumed to be a way to weed out non-serious applicants.  

**Unfortunately,** BC academy did not hold itself to equally stringent conditions and appears to be an instructor-churning factory with little regard for serious students and Pilates in general.  

However, as this is my first time signing up for a course, I would like to hear thoughts from seasoned Pilates practitioners/studio owners who have gone through certification if what BC does is considered normal: 

1. As the course would be conducted in mandarin, I asked a Pilates teacher if it would be hard for me to catch up (I understand conversational mandarin) and she assured me that there will be newbies with zero background in Pilates so I would be fine with my background. Is it normal for an academy to take in students with *zero background in Pilates*? In my home country, it is strongly recommended for new students to take a couple of privates before moving onto group classes, much less a Pilates *instructor* course.  
2. Less than 1 week before the course commencement, I was informed that due to “less than ideal enrollment” my course would be cancelled. This was extremely unprofessional as I understood the commitment needed for the course and hence, have scheduled care-taking and other stuff to make sure that I could attend every day. Basically I arranged and freed up my schedule for months ahead for nothing. 
3. Liaison officer told me to fly to another city instead for the course (which might be cancelled too, who knows?), which is ridiculous because there was never a clause in the contract that the course would be cancelled if it did not meet numbers. Of course, I understand it is a business but I would think minimally 8 students enrolled would be a reasonable number to proceed with the course. Also, I refuse to incur additional cost and risks to fly to other cities monthly given the Covid Zero situation in China, for those who are aware.  
4. Liaison officer refused to explain what was “less than ideal enrollment”. Based on what I see on social media on BC’s courses, each course has >20 students to 1 teacher, usually 1 teacher to 22 to 24 students.  
5. Compared to the Stott course here in China (18,000RMB/2500USD for reformer course) that has a teacher-student ratio of 1:12, the BC course seems to be jam-packed to maximise enrollment and profits. 
6. Upon reading the school catalog ([http://www.bodyconceptpilates.com/SchoolCatalog\_en.pdf](http://www.bodyconceptpilates.com/SchoolCatalog_en.pdf)), one of the KPI for BC is “to graduate 400 Pilates teachers within 6 years”, which seems to be focused on churning out instructors as though they are iPhones. Is this KPI normal for Balanced Body, BASI, Stott etc.? 
7. Another KPI is “To develop continuing education programs for our graduates in 2021”- well nobody said they had to be quality programmes where the teacher-student ratio allows for meaningful exchanges 
8. The catalog also mentions that “if a student misses class... may mean they need to purchase a session with a mentor assigned by the director of the school. Per session price is 950 RMB/55mins.” Is this a normal condition for other schools? 

I cannot speak for other countries but Body Concept classes are priced higher than the established academies in China yet, seem to be operating like a factory where they are fixated with money/profits and gaining dominant market share (“400 instructors in 6 years”).

1664062191.0,Beginner question - is it common for reformer Pilates to feel like HIIT?,"I went to one of the most popular local reformer Pilates studio for the first time and felt confused as it feels like HIIT to me, this is the routine we had: warm up, crunches, lunges, leg raises, back raise, etc. The instructor also didn’t set up a rep numbers for us and asked everyone to do as many as possible.

The problem I have is that, it feels like HIIT to me instead of what I heard about Pilates. It’s similar to the cardio workout and my muscle doesn’t hurt the following day. 

Side note, I do feel my core tightening, but I’m attributing it to the crunches.

So I’m wondering if it’s normal for a Pilates reformer routine to be like this, or should I try another studio? I took Pilates because I want to increase body awareness, therefore would love to find a high quality studio given the money I paid.

1659105567.0,Is it worth paying for private classes with a Reformer if you're already doing pilates mat? Especially as a runner.,"I am currently in the process of rehabbing from a foot injury caused by running, and I think the source of my issues was bad form and not engaging the right muscles due to a weak core and glutes from a sedentary office lifestyle. I wasn't used to running and athletics in general so when I attempted to increase my mileage, the right muscles wouldn't fire up and my foot got the brunt of my issues.

I got the injury two years ago and no matter how much physical therapy exercises and treatments I did, it would start hurting only a quarter mile into running. But ever since doing barre and pilates mat (almost daily for 6 months), I am able to run again without completely irritating my feet. But, there are still some issues that I think I can improve.

I am thinking of adding reformer pilates to my routine for a couple months to see if it would help any further, because I remember a lot of shaking and firing up muscles that I didn't even know existed while trying the reformer (with who I think was a good instructor). I don't think mat pilates is anywhere near as similar as reformer pilates. But an hour session of reformer is like $100 (though I probably can find cheaper if I shop around). I'll do it if it gives me an edge as a runner. To make it effective, how often should I go? Is weekly enough?",pilates,2022-07-29 14:39:27

These are my take aways: 1) be kind to my body, appreciate it for what it can do instead of what it can’t. 2) Blogilates is a fitness channel NOT a Pilates channel (can’t believe I missed the big warning in the subreddit info lol my bad). 3) focus on the basics and get them right! 

I want to start this by saying that I am SO weak, shockingly weak. I always have been and I have always really struggled. I have been working hard the last six weeks since quarantine started and have really improved all over, but I still feel weaker than I think even the starting point for most people. 

I started Pilates at the beginning of this year but the class I took got cancelled, and then Covid came along, so I’ve been practising at home. I’m currently doing the Blogilates 7 day ab challenge but I’m really struggling with the mentioned movements. Even with my hands in a triangle under my tailbone, my core just isn’t strong enough to keep my lower back pressed to the mat. 

I know the solution to this is to lift my legs higher when doing these moves, but I am also incredibly inflexible. I’ve been working on this but I can’t straighten my legs directly up. So I lower to a point I can straighten my legs and bam, my lower back lifts again. If I keep my legs slightly bent, I don’t feel like I’m getting the benefit of the exercise and that I’ll never be able to get strong enough just doing this in order to progress. 

I just feel so frustrated, it’s like a vicious cycle. Can’t get stronger unless I can do the moves right, can’t do the moves right until I get stronger. Add my absolutely embarrassing lack of flexibility and at the end of each work out I feel defeated instead of energised.

My instructor says that I have a very weak core and that is part of why I have a belly that sticks out. She is teaching me how to inhale/exhale.  


First, I lied down on a machine and she said that I need to inhale by breathing in and my my belly should inflate like a balloon, and also my ribs should expand outwards. I think my whole life, I've only ever inhaled where I stick out my belly and fill it up. I did not realize I need to laterally inhale and expand my ribcage.   


For exhaling, she said I need to suck in my belly and pull up. I watched a lot of videos, and I think I understand that more than inhaling. It's like a motion where you can pull in and up, if I'm not mistaken.  


I still do not know how to inhale. I've tried watching numerous videos yesterday and today, and I may be misunderstanding, but it seems like I'm seeing some instructors who say that you need to inhale and your ribcage will expand, but they omit/ignore that belly expanding. I don't see their stomach going out like a balloon when they inhale. 

It also feels unnatural for me to inhale with my stomach going big while simultaneously having my ribs expand, and then having my belly going inwards and upwards upon exhalation. Sometimes I find it easier, upon exhalation, where it's more tight/engaged (?), to just keep it that way and then inhale laterally, but then I can't expand my stomach while I inhale because my stomach is flexed, so it just flops out like a belly. I'm not sure how to explain, but I'm sure I'm doing something wrong and I'm worried my instructor is going to get frustrated explaining it to me.

Should I keep my stomach tight upon exhalation and just keep it tight the whole time? Should I just continue inhaling with my belly getting big and my ribs expanding? Why do some instructors show that their ribs are expanding but their tummies are not getting larger upon inhalation? Should I also be inhaling/exhaling like this 24/7?

Sorry for the massive wall of text. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I have another session on Monday and I feel bad that I'm not understanding how to breathe. It seems easier lying down than sitting up or standing.

Edit: Thank you for the replies!! I appreciate everyone’s help :) It was eye-opening to read.",pilates,2023-04-22 20:45:12
1680641962.0,Pilates App - Reformer,"
Hello everyone, 

I started Pilates recently at Club Pilates. I was very lucky to start when I did. They were 2 days away from raising the prices. I pay $199 for unlimited and they were raising to I think $228. So now I am paying less than the current rate for the 8 pack. Very fortunate. I love the classes and I am fully ready to commit to Pilates. The problem is the most convenient classes for me are the level 1.5. I’ve been finding classes but the level 1 also have very long waitlists unless I book them a month ahead which I have since done, but as someone who’s schedule can change its not always easy to find another class. I also am eager to try some of the different class types which seems to happen at 1.5. I have no delusions I am definitely level 1. I looked into private classes, but in addition to what I’m already paying I can’t justify spending that kind of money. I found an at home reformer that is reasonably priced. I intend to still go to Club Pilates, but on days when I don’t go I would like to practice on my own. Although I love the classes I feel like I won’t progress very fast. I feel like I’m missing the “instruction” part. The instructors will say what to do, but I have to look next to me to have a clue where to start. The other day I was looking at a post here someone was talking about neutral spine vs imprinted spine. No one has ever said anything like that in any of my classes. I was thinking with a home reformer and an app I can start getting the basics so that I can progress. Does anyone have any app suggestions that have reformer Pilates?",pilates,2023-04-04 20:59:22

It totally got rid of the pain I've been feeling since starting pilates classes a few weeks ago. Can anyone recommend other videos I can do to help get rid of sciatica pain on YouTube? Thanks for any advice! The instructor at the YMCA I've been seeing said that pain is normal for some people and to push through it with modifications, but it hurts, and I don't want to injure myself.

1676163899.0,Seeking beginner pilates videos with a specific kind of instructor.,"Hello! I'm new to pilates and besides biking, hiking, dancing, and yoga have little work out experience and am quite sedentary in my life because of school and lots of studying.

I'm trying out new to me types of exercise and pilates appeals to me since it's similar to yoga and I've always had a weak core + want it to be stronger.

At the moment, I'm most comfortable with body doubling exercises (aka watching youtube videos) so I'm wondering if anyone knows of any free, beginner-friendly, and limited to no talking (but I can be flexible with that) pilates videos I should try out? I prefer instructors that aren't sharing thoughts about religion, heteronormative, or new-agey (no offence to those who are. It just doesn't resonate with me.) and are body-positive/ not talking much about weight loss/diet.

Edit to state: I also prefer mat pilates/no equipment videos though I do have 5lb weights and would be willing to give those a try.",pilates,2023-02-12 01:04:59

1664842873.0,Advanced exercises,"Pilates is a practice and takes time to learn and progress.  Truly embodying the fundamentals takes time. Building up to the advanced exercises can take many many months or years.  

The value of the practice is the practice.  You’ll get results by practicing consistently.  You don’t get better results from doing more advanced exercises, especially if you jump to them before you’re really ready.  

Those advanced exercises are not always appropriate for everyone. Don’t worry if you’ve been doing Pilates for a few months and can’t yet do a “perfect” roll up or teaser! These exercises are designed to be hard! The practice builds upon itself.  Trust your consistent practice.  Work with a skilled teacher when you need more help. And know that even after decades of practice you’ll still be getting benefits from the basic fundamentals as long as you’re connected to your mind, breath and body.  That’s the real value of Pilates.  Not fancy hard moves you see on tik tok.",pilates,2022-10-04 00:21:13

I have gotten pretty solid over the years and can go through decent intensity workouts with semi ease while maintaining proper alignment and core engagement. My question is for those experienced on the reformer. Is it worth it to spend some time on the reformer or would sticking to the mat hold the same benefit? Am I missing out on anything?

I’m a former athlete with some injuries that have left me with more sensitive and loose limbs and I just really dislike high impact stuff on my joints.  I also have PCOS and Endometriosis so I have to try to keep my cortisol levels down so as not to become very inflamed.  I’ve been loving the Pilates workouts I’ve been doing on YouTube and it makes me fear the gym less since I gained 30 pounds from Prozac.  I have been on ozempic now and i believe my diet is pretty good and that alone has been helpful.

1641526487.0,Questions from someone with pretty much 0 abdominal strength,"As I said, I have nearly 0 abdominal strength. I mean it. I have endometriosis and my abdomen went through 4 surgeries in 5 years. My pelvic floor is hyper tonic and my body has adjusted to use my glutes, legs, and back to support me. :)

I’m trying to get my body back into shape and my physical therapist recommended Pilates but I struggle with the whole activating my core deal.

My questions for y’all are:

1) Do you have any tips for the mine muscle connection? Any cues you use personally?
2) Are there any beginner Pilates ab movements you highly recommend for someone who has a hard time connecting with their core? Think baby steps for gaining core strength.
3) Mat or Reformer classes?
4) Any studio recommendations in the San Diego area?

Prior to this I used to be able to lift weights and was generally very active and loved going to the gym. My last surgery really seemed to do me in. I just want to be able to move again y’all. :,) Any help is so appreciated!",pilates,2022-01-07 03:34:47
